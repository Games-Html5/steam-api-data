But make no mistake \u2013 this is no fight for victory, but a desperate grasp for survival.<br> <br>Bad North is a charming but brutal real-time tactics roguelite. Defend your idyllic island kingdom against a horde of Viking invaders, as you lead the desperate exodus of your people. Command your loyal subjects to take full tactical advantage of the unique shape of each island.

You control the broad strokes of the battle, giving high level commands to your soldiers who try their best to carry them out in the heat of the moment. It\u2019s accessibly deep, with simple player inputs masking a dynamic combat simulation that make it inviting to new players while challenging veterans.<br> <br>Keep fighting, warriors.
