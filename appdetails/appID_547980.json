With rabbit ears. <br />\n<br />\nPeople have been grumbling about the goings-on below town. Seems there's some sort of magic lantern that's throwing the whole joint into chaos. Yeah, that's what I said too! Full of it, they gotta' be, right? Turns out- not so much.. <br />\n<br />\nSo.. What's it you do again, kid? Warrior? Thief? Wizard? Cleric??! Cultist??!!<br />\nOH! A lawyer!? <br />\n<br />\nHahaha, well you sure had me fooled there for a while.. little jerk.. <br />\n<br />\nHere's what you're gonna' do: Head below town, JUST FOR ME, and see what the hell that Lantern's on about. They tell me it turns all kinds of colors, and each color changes the rules. <br />\n<br />\nHow so!? What am I, an electrician?!? <br />\nThat's up to you to find out! <br />\n<br />\nAnd so you did! <br />\n<br />\n--- <br />\n<br />\nEquin: The Lantern is my fun roguelike with some wholly original ideas. Easy to get into, tough to master. Conquer the 50 floor dungeon and its evil inhabitants in a quest to the bottom of the joint to find the mysterious lantern itself. With features like a turn-based 1st person battle system, Auto Killing weaker enemies, an XP Hit Streak bonus, hundreds of weapons and armor to find, diabolical floor events to shake things up, a lantern who screws with the rules, and oh yeah- PERMADEATH BABY, this is the game for those who like a good challenge. <br />\n<br />\nSTRATEGERIZE by slamming doors in your enemy's face to lock them in a room, or lead them into a web and trap their stank @sses. Watch out for stronger champ versions though and much stronger bosses at every turn! <br />\n<br />\nNOTE: This time around I got some help from the fantasic Rocco W and his sick 8-bit tunes! They were so good I decided to scrap all my own music except for the title theme.",
