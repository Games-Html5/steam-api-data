  "detailed_description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Multiplayer VR flying FPS game</h2>BattleSky VR is a <strong>Multiplayer VR shooter game</strong> at its core, bringing <strong>Overwatch</strong> style gameplay to the VR platform.  Each player picks a Hero with vastly different size, powers and gameplay style to engage in fast-paced aerial combats against other players.  Play online against other players with classic Team Deathmatch, Team Escort, Free For All, Attack and Defend, and other team based modes of up to 4v4 players!  Pick your Heroes wisely, your unique powers will determine gameplay strategies as you team up to defeat the opponents!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Single Player Mission Mode</h2>Each Hero has a single player mission mode where you'll learn the back story about the Heroes, and get familiar with the controls and the unique Flying Locomotion.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Co-op missions</h2>We are adding new co-op missions that allow 1-4 players to team up against A.I.  Our first Co-op mission is Co-op escort.  Players team up to escort an airship to the destination while fighting off A.I.  We will be adding more co-op modes as we develop the game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Unique VR Locomotion</h2>The game\u2019s unique hyper-speed flying locomotion mechanisms had been tested by over 500 testers, and has been fine-tuned to allow nausea-free extreme high speed flying (imagine flying at 250 km/h).  Less than 10% of the testers had experienced motion sickness, and out of this 10%, most of them only experienced motion sickness with one of the two heroes; A very small percentage experienced motion sickness with both Heroes. With 4 (or more) heroes planned for the game by the time we exit Early Access, players will be sure to find a hero that matches their play style.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Which Hero do you want to be?</h2>At beginning of early Access, two Heroes will be accessible: <strong>Draco</strong>, and <strong>Jet-9</strong>.  The third Hero is <strong>Lady V</strong>, and it is being developed.  Will you flap your wings to soar through the sky as <strong>Draco</strong>? Or, zoom through the sky with the hand thrusters as <strong>Jet-9</strong>? As we develop the game further during Early Access, we look forward to YOUR feedback and suggestions as we add more Heroes, each with unique flying and battle capabilities.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Early Access</h2>We want to engage the gaming community during Early Access and continue to add more Heroes, Maps, and Gameplay Modes as we develop the game continuously.  We look forward to your feedback and help us shape this unique VR game. Please see the &quot;Early Access&quot; section for what content will be available at launch of Early Access.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Our Ultimate Goal</h2>Our goal is to create a <strong>Multiplayer VR FPS game</strong> that will define a new generation of e-Sport.  We hope to co-create with YOU a game that has depth, encourages strategic gameplay, and is just awesome and unlike any other experiences on VR.  Please see the &quot;Early Access&quot; section for what content we plan to complete by the time we exit Early Access.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">VR</h2>This game requires a VR system.  The game will initially only support HTC Vive when we start Early Access.  The game works with Oculus but may be trick for those without the 3-sensor 360 setup for oculus.",
