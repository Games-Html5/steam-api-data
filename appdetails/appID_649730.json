[checks clipboard] ...very soon.<br><br>This is just the first of two big updates coming up. The second one is a little more hush-hush, but I have been authorised by upper management to tell you it will be a major content update including\u2026 [checks clipboard] ...lots of stuff.<br><br>The complete list of features is still under wraps, but the word around the water cooler is that it will include big improvements to office workflow, new activities to engage in, and\u2026 [checks clipboard] ... Steam achievements. I\u2019m not sure what that is. Something the young folks like, I think.<br><br>All of this was made possible by support from Film Victoria, and upper management have officially declared that Film Victoria are\u2026 [checks clipboard] ...awesome.<br><br>So there we have it. To stay up to date with our upcoming announcements, you should follow the official Future State Machine Twitter account. But, you know, on your lunch break, because you shouldn\u2019t be using Twitter during work hours.<br><br>Okay, time to get back to work!<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/649730/extras/Film_Victoria_State_Gov_logo_small.jpg?t=1523406583\" ></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/649730/extras/Header_SteamPage_About_08.png?t=1523406583\" ><br><br><br>You know the program: get a job, work, retire, then die. But what if you could short circuit the employment machine, interrupt the process, and escape?<br><br><br>You\u2019re the new hire at a dreary office, recruited after your predecessor lost his head (literally). You\u2019re expected to keep quiet, do your work, and be just another cog in a big machine, but instead you start chatting with your new colleagues. Each of them is a robot like you, disappointed by life and despairing of ever achieving their goals, resigned to spending the rest of their days stuck at a desk and staring at a screen.<br><br><br>However, if you can get to know your co-workers, learning about their dreams and their secret loves, you might be able to help them. In the course of bringing a little bit of happiness to a group of depressed robots, you may even discover a way to escape this dead end job and find a little happiness of your own.<br><br><br><i>OfficeBots: Reality Bytes [VR] </i>is a little game with a big heart.
