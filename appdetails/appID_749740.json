It contains the same parts of the Universe as humanity does, but much more in a darker, colder and hostile manner. Play as a part of &quot;Black Sky&quot; division and explore the Underworld, gather information and artifacts. Engage only if necessary!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Story:</h2><br>In mid 1980's, during a top secret experimental mission, a gate to the Underworld opened at Wankings National Laboratory. Since then, scientists were trying to figure out the way of closing the gate, as well as gathering artifacts and learning more about species from the alternate dimension. While closing the gate wasn't a priority, a group of CIA agents along with scientists have created a research divison called &quot;Dark Matter&quot; which was focusing on the Underworld's dimension research. After last two trials, where groups of five were sent to gather information, Dark Matter division learned that the Underworld is more hostile than ever, yet it consists more portals through-out it's own dimension. Since then, in late 1980's a new division was formed called &quot;Black Sky&quot;, which was more militarized and consisted only of three people, two of which have lost their life while conducting a research in the Underworld. Hence, you are the only survivor of the Black Sky and your mission is to explore the Underworld, gather evidence along with artifacts and make sure to survive.<br><br>Wankings National Laboratory is a federal complex located in Wankings, Indiana. It is currently controlled by CIA agents and a Soviet Research Group (SRG). The laboratory itself is a very secret and private facility, which is surrounded by barbed wire fences and guarded by the private military contractors; yet, is very well hidden from the public and only accessible by designated staff.",
