  "detailed_description": "The game is set in a grim cyber-punk world. As an experienced burglar you fight for your life in the middle of mega-corporations turf war. Usually the gameplay aim is to infiltrate a huge randomly generated security base, find a specific item (most likely hidden in an alarm-rigged safe) and get out in one piece.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New challenging infiltration every time</h2><br>Each mission will present you with a completely new procedurally generated level. The generation algorithm we are working on is pretty complex and aimed at building vast, open environments filled with obstacles, enemies and collectibles. There are always multiple ways to reach your goals and no pre-designed solutions exist. You are on your own.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Deep playing style customization</h2><br>Find and steal upgrades for your suit during the missions. Abilities and traits you receive from these upgrades may completely change the way you play the game. Hide in the shadows and climb between the rooftops unnoticed? Break through the walls and take down multiple enemies at a time? Or, may be, rule the cyberworld and exploit your enemies instead? The choice is yours.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\u201cAdaptive Alarms\u201d system</h2><br>The level you are infiltrating is not a decoration but a living, breathing world. Security systems are smart and trying their best to coordinate the defense. Your activity is analyzed and alarms system is trying to adapt to your playing style. Responsive strategy and imminent reinforcements will keep you on your toes. Get out alive.",
