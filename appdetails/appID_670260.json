Early access means quite literally that the game is not finished!<br><br>My name is Kyle Postlewait (34) and I started this years ago because I can't find the game that I want to play. I am not a veteran game developer. I do not have any published AAA titles. I am self-taught and I make mistakes. Having said that, I'm tired of survival crafting games being abandoned, focusing only on PvP and guns, or turning into major time sinks. I'm doing everything I can to make a great fantasy survival RPG despite the tremendous challenge that is game development. I am trying to be very honest: the game is far from finished! Please don't buy early access expecting a fully polished game and then give it a bad review. In return, I promise to make sure that this game is NEVER ABANDONED. If sales are more than enough for me to survive, then I can hire more help. But first and foremost I will always work to secure financial longevity and legal stability, and maintain all intellectual rights, never selling power to sponsors, publishers, or anything that could ever possibly endanger continued development.<br><br>Please keep in mind that Early Access means the game is not fit to be put in a box and sold on a shelf. Early access ends when there is enough content to constitute selling the game to someone that did read the above warning! Even after we leave early access the game will continue to be improved and expanded on, and has a long list of planned features post early access including other dimensions and multiplayer.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Short description</h2>(Many features listed here are still under development)<br>Solace Crafting is a crafting and building heavy survival RPG focused around building towns and summoning NPC townspeople. We are sent through different dimensions questing for a way to defeat the corrupting hatred that is spreading throughout the multiverse. With an open class system, open-recipe crafting, open-recipe enchanting, modular building, defensive structures, town management quests and rewards, distance-based difficulty, and an infinite game world, players are free to move and quest at their own pace. With an uncapped leveling system you can try to push further than anyone ever has. You can try and make the ultimate sword, staff, or anything, thanks to complete control over all recipe settings. Build massive towns full of NPCs not limited by physics-based construction. Seek out rare enchants and exotic resources in the elemental planes. Find a way into the heart of the demonic planes and face hatred head on to jump-start the next phase in evolution for all of creation.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About the game</h2>(All of these features are currently incomplete and undergoing constant improvement)<br><strong><u>Survival</u></strong><br>Solace Crafting starts out much like similar survival games: you need to make clothes to avoid freezing to death, you need to find food to keep from starving to death, and you should build shelter from the dangers of nightfall.<br><strong><u>Crafting</u></strong><br>Once you are surviving it's time to evolve. Build resource processing and crafting facilities to create improved weapons and armor. Leveling up your professions levels up your recipes and allows you to unlock new recipes and crafting abilities. Our crafting system is quite unique, allowing even the creation of custom sets. I definitely recommend you watch the (slightly dated) video on player crafting available above.<br><strong><u>Role-Playing Game</u></strong><br>Once you're armed and ready it's time to push back against evil and it's minions. Level-up and develop your character using an open-class system of evolving skill trees. Mix melee, ranged, magic, and heals however you like. Skills are being designed with fun and visual uniqueness in mind, not minimalism and strict balance.<br><strong><u>Solace Crafting</u></strong><br>Once you're capable of venturing far enough away from the core shard where you start, it's time to start crafting your own solaces. Crafting and placing a solace will allow you to instantly return to it from any other solace in the world, letting you choose your own points of interest. Be careful though as the further you travel in any direction, the more difficult everything becomes. In order to level up a solace you'll have to defend it from waves of attackers that will try and stop the procedure. Build static defenses and summon NPC guards to help protect your solaces during upgrades and town quests.<br><strong><u>Town Management</u></strong> (not yet under development)<br>An upgraded solace allows you to summon NPCs ranging from gatherers and crafters, to quest givers and class trainers. Each town is however limited by its level which is determined by its location in the world. In order to summon higher level NPCs and unlock higher level quests you'll need to push deeper into the wild, setting up towns of various sizes as you go, even in other dimensions. Sometimes you may only need a new gathering outpost for higher tiered resources, other times you may want a sprawling city to unlock new skills, recipes, and achievements with.<br><strong><u>Astral Travel</u></strong> (not yet under development)<br>When the time is right you will find your way to the Elemental Planes. Most heavily affected by the spreading hatred these have becomes dimensions of extreme danger, both environmental and sentient. You must find out where the hatred stems from and find a way to put an end to it once and for all. The Elemental Planes are also the birthplace of all resources mundane and exotic alike. Only here will you find the purest, most powerful resources for crafting and enchanting equipment worthy of a hero.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Developed by a gamer</h2>I started learning how to make games years ago because the design decisions of so many of the games I played often made so little sense to me.
