The characters and music do a great job of setting the atmosphere, and short matches slow down the stale feeling that comes with playing a free-to-play game repetitively.\u201d<br>80% \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://gamingillustrated.com/3on3-freestyle-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Gaming Illustrated</a></a><br><br>\u201c3on3 FreeStyle may not be NBA 2K, but it still holds up with great mechanics, simple controls, and cell-shaded graphics. Having no story, a few soundtracks and the lack of locations does not hinder the games appeal There is no denying that this a good game to have a little fun with once in a while.\u201d<br>84% \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.thezombiechimp.com/2017/05/17/3-on-3-freestyle-ps4-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >The Zombie Chimp</a></a><br>",
