For example, the giant sand worm can be called up by attaching the missing part (A) to the worm charmer (B), or to destroy the antenna to cause a meteor shower. <br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/355400/extras/DesertWorm.jpg?t=1521625269\" ><br><i>Interactive elements on map - giant sand worm.</i><br><br><br>Also available game modes such as deathmatch in which each player fights for survival and the team match, in which two teams play against each other to get the bomb and take it to the enemy base to destroy the base. <br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/355400/extras/TeamMatch.jpg?t=1521625269\" >",
