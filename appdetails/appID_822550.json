  "detailed_description": "2DGameMania's Taken is a 2.5D retro platform game in which you have been taken by the unknown and you need to fight your way to freedom. Fight your way through multiple enemies types and obstacles and use your special powers such as the beam weapon which fire bursts of bullets in a 360 motion, laser wipe which will swipe across the screen killing most things in its path and not forgetting your trusty gun which again holds different bullet types.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are lots of collectibles and extra points awarded for killing more enemies, which are then added up after each level.  If you achieve a top 10 score, your score will be recorded along with the amount of time you took to complete the game...especially good for speed-runs.  There are achievements for completing the game in a fast time.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nGood replay value, lots of hidden areas to find and explore, varied levels and always good to try and beat that high score!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFour huge levels and bosses. At the end of each level you need to collect the teleporter part and find the teleporter to gain access to the next level within a certain amount of time otherwise a big explosion will come your way!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInspired from some of the old classic Amiga platform games, hopefully this game will bring back some memories.",
