Like a game engine, Unbound can have thousands of objects in a scene. And every thing is always changeable.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Compact Models</h2>Unbound models are tiny when you save them. This makes sharing a model over the network and bringing them into a collaborative space pretty much instantaneous.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Physically Based Material System</h2>Mix materials as you craft, sculpt or spay paint on models. The volume and surface of creators edits are stored internally, for use during saves.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Export</h2>Creators have the ability to export mesh models from Unbound\u2019s volumetric format. Take your models with you and continue using your favorite tools, whether it\u2019s game development, rendering or 3D printing.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Important Note:</strong></h2><strong>Unbound will only run on NVIDIA GPUs for some time after launching in Early Access. Most of our algorithms are heavy on GPU compute and as a small team, development really benefited from building with CUDA. Once Unbound is ready to be optimized, we are planning to port this to AMD. We kindly ask for your patience and understanding.</strong>",
