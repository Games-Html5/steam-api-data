  "detailed_description": "<h1>Just Updated</h1><p>It's a dirty job, but someone's got to do it.<br><br>Hunter has arrived. He's brought with him sweeping changes to Phantom, a reworked version of Terminal and a whole host of changes!<br><br>Update Notes:<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Released: Hunter</h2><br>The Alaskan Hunter may be a man of few words, but with a short-temper and a state of the art arsenal MercSERV couldn\u2019t wait to get him on the books.<br><br>Hunter brings with him a brand new set of weapons; from the slow firing, hard hitting Ryburn machine pistol, to the short range, fast firing Averarov 9 pistol. He also carries the stylish and deadly Ulu.<br><br>His Special Edition Loadout Card is also available in the store.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Reworked: Phantom</h2><br>Phantom has always been one of the more polarising Mercs, often being being fun to play, but fairly limited in team-viability and utility in comparison to other Mercs. With these changes, Phantom will be more of a \u2018silent operative\u2019, capable of sneaking behind enemy lines to cause disruption with his EMP Wave and first-shot potential.<br><br>Phantom\u2019s Obsidian Operative Loadout Card also returns to the store.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Reworked: Terminal</h2><br>The goal with all Dirty Bomb maps is to have the first objective be completed nearly every time, as we feel what keeps the maps enjoyable to play is the sense of progression rather than being stuck on the first objective all game. Our telemetry showed that Terminals first objective was the least completed in the game. Terminal Redux seeks to make the first objective attacker sided, this involved a full rebuild of the first objective space and its objectives, primary and secondary. You will still recognise the themes in Terminal but with a new layout that after many tests we feel tilts the balance in Jackals favour.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New Armory UI</h2><br>With the introduction of Merc Decks, we gave you more options for customising your Mercs through the Barracks. However, managing your content has always been frustrating.<br><br>We\u2019re proud to introduce you to the Armory. We\u2019ve updated the filtering and sorting options for you to split up your content more effectively, and we\u2019ve added a new search bar for you to find specific cards quickly and add these directly into your Merc Decks.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PRICING UPDATE</h2><br>With Hunter\u2019s arrival, we\u2019re also updating some of our Merc pricing:<br><br>Turtle was 50,000 Credits or $9.99 \u2192 is now 45,000 or $8.99<br>Redeye was 45,000 Credits or $8.99 \u2192 is now 40,000 Credits or $7.99<br>Arty was 35,000 Credits or $6.99 \u2192 is now 30,000 Credits or $5.99<br>All three Mercs are included in the All Merc Pack, which gives you access to all current and future Mercs (including Hunter), which is available on Steam.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">WEAPON WEAR UPDATE</h2><br>We have upgraded the look of all of our Weapon Skins across the board. We felt that they weren\u2019t desirable enough, and those towards the bottom end weren\u2019t reflective of the quality of work that we want to be associated with. We also feel that, when you guys get these skins, you want to feel awesome, and these changes should allow you to do that! We have improved the memory footprint of each gun as well, meaning that performance has improved across the board.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MAP FIXES</h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BRIDGE</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>New updated minimap bringing it in line with Castle\u2019s and Vault\u2019s<br></li><li>Stopped map entering critical path blocker on EV section with the barrier<br></li><li>Stopped turtle being able to deploy shield on top of MG<br></li><li>Removed assets that blocked Kira, Skyhammer and Arty strikes on EV section<br></li><li>Raised height of ceiling at top of train bridge stairs to stop players hitting head<br></li><li>Fixed issue where you could not throw packs over objects by the GH Square wall<br></li><li>Fixed collision at top of station escalator causing players to get stuck<br></li><li>Fixed inaccurate collision on train carriage on rail bridge<br></li><li>Added collision on AC vent in attackers spawn<br></li><li>Updated collision on area around GH building barricade wreckage that caused sticky movement<br></li><li>Moved intro objective marker so it didn\u2019t clip<br></li><li>Fixed Z fighting on asset post explosion effect<br></li><li>Stopped trigger volume blocking explosives around the EV barricade<br></li><li>Fixed several locations where you could see outside of the world<br></li><li>By the GH Courtyard<br></li><li>In the MG Building<br></li><li>In the Office<br></li><li>In the Attackers spawn and Back Alley<br></li><li>Replaced old quality Bus asset in OOB<br></li><li>Fixed issues with graffiti rendering strangely in Defenders spawn<br></li><li>Fixed lightmaps on door frame<br></li><li>Fixed misaligned textures in GH building<br></li><li>Fixed seams in assets in Garage<br></li><li>Improved global sky texture to remove seams<br></li><li>Fixed textures on steps in Office<br></li><li>Fixed CDA barricade floating asset<br></li><li>Fixed textures on escalators<br></li><li>Fixed collision on Underground sign on Station Road<br></li><li>Fixed Z fighting on windows</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">TRAINYARD</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>New updated minimap bringing it in line with Castle\u2019s and Vault\u2019s<br></li><li>Reset kill volumes on map reset on second objective train carriage<br></li><li>Updated collision to smooth out snag at defenders spawn<br></li><li>Fixed several locations where you could see outside of the world near:<br></li><li>Gas Tower<br></li><li>Blocker Carriage<br></li><li>Spawn Warehouse<br></li><li>Warehouse<br></li><li>FTL Backyard<br></li><li>Updated collision in Smashed Train Wall to prevent mines being planted under the terrain on High Spec<br></li><li>Added collision to ceiling to stop player jumping head into ceiling in Smashed Train wall<br></li><li>Removed floating decals on train at Track Gate<br></li><li>Removed collision by ammo box in Signal Box<br></li><li>Fixed issue where you could not throw packs over objects by:<br></li><li>Last objective bridge<br></li><li>Last objective defender spawn<br></li><li>Second objective secondary gate<br></li><li>Removed asset that was only available on high graphics settings, that impeded on gameplay space<br></li><li>Partial fix for collision issue on attackers left ramp trick jump<br></li><li>Stitched a single proxy which was being hidden in game in the MG building<br></li><li>Replaced an expensive to render asset with a cheaper one<br></li><li>Made pipe with collision visible on minimal settings<br></li><li>Smoothed collision by Disused Bridge<br></li><li>Added trims to hide texture seams<br></li><li>Fixed clipping pipe asset<br></li><li>Improved look of objective 1 area after it has exploded to include damage on more nearby assets<br></li><li>Fixed clipping trash asset<br></li><li>Added collision to pipes in Smashed Train Wall building<br></li><li>Made rubble pile with collision visible on minimal settings<br></li><li>Visual fix to vertex painting on mound asset<br></li><li>Removed window sill in MG building to fix collision issues<br></li><li>Moved track slightly to stop z-fighting<br></li><li>Fixed clipping asset in MG building<br></li><li>Smoothed collision on bush assets by Track Gate Approach<br></li><li>Change light environment bounds on container door to include the dominant light<br></li><li>Fixed missing text string when going into overtime on final objective<br></li><li>Turned off shadow casting on decal elements on milk jug delivery</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">WEAPON UPDATES: SNIPER BALANCE</h2><br>Sniper animation timings have been adjusted to improve the feel when using these weapons. This should be a good middle-ground between the old functionality and the recent changes, which means you can now switch weapons quicker after firing, although the case eject animations are a little slower to compensate.<br><br>MoA SNPR-1:<br><br>Fire-duration timing reduced to 0.7s (was 0.9s)<br>Case eject timing increased to 0.8s (was 0.6s)<br><br>FEL-IX:<br><br>Fire-duration timing reduced to 0.8s (was 1.0s)<br>Case eject timing increased to 0.9s (was 0.7s)<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CMM IMPROVEMENTS</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Solo players in Casual Matchmaking will begin automatically queuing again in the background when on the match review screen<br></li><li>Fixed a rare bug at the end of a match, where players remained stuck on \u201cDisconnecting\u201d screen<br></li><li>Fixed a bug where the Merc/Loadout switch UI did not dismiss on match loading animation<br></li><li>Fixed a bug with odd faction colors in the post-game chat<br></li><li>Fixed a bug with players not going back into searching for a match, when a server was not found after the Team-Lineup</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">TRANSLATIONS</h2><br>Added and corrected numerous translations, as part of our ongoing effort to make the game more accessible and enjoyable for our international players.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">OTHER CHANGES AND FIXES</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Fixed an issue where Loadout Case drops wouldn\u2019t be displayed on the post-match rewards screen<br></li><li>Reworked \u2018Recent Matches\u2019 screen to allow for better readability and quick access to past MVP screens, bringing it in line with the post-match lobby<br></li><li>Fixed a bug with Crafting Kits not being awarded after reaching Level 4.
