  "detailed_description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Game</h2><br>As a mechanic, you and your dragon explore what\u2019s left of mankind\u2019s last refuge: a fleet of gigantic, flying ships, hovering over an endless ocean. In order to survive in this post-apocalyptic world, you will need to scavenge your surroundings and fight off hostile machines. Protect yourself from creatures and other players: Build your base-tower, upgrade it and evolve to craft better gear, and create your own food supply.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The World</h2><br>After the invention of the steam engine, humanity was at the height of its ingenuity, being able to create all sorts of technical wonders. Then, however, a horrible disaster struck, that flooded the earth and rendered the few remaining patches of land uninhabitable.<br><br>Foreseeing this tragic event, the greatest engineers built habitats with ecosystems to their liking in the form of huge, flying ships. This fleet, being able to escape the dangers of the flood, would become the peaceful home of mankind for centuries.<br><br> <br>This changed when the dragons appeared; they began attacking the ships, and thus the Dragon War began. Through the ingenuity of humankind, mechanical monsters began to be built to combat their new foes. This wasn't enough, though: humanity fought until no warriors were left, and the few who survived were left to one basic principle: Every man for himself.<br><br>Humanity was defeated, the fleet scattered, but the automated factories inside the ships continued producing monsters. With no continued maintenance, errors in production were bound to occur. The machines malfunctioned and began attacking everything living and breathing.<br><br> <br>You are one of the few survivors of what was once a great Victorian civilization. As your day starts and you are out gathering food, you come across a young dragon. It begins to follow you as you go about your duties, and you eventually realize: this dragon is your new companion. Take care of it, and you will grow stronger together.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mechanics</h2><br>When you arrive in the world of DARCO, you are given a choice of which elemental dragon you would like to start with. This starter dragon is your companion, never leaving your side throughout the game. Your life will be hard; as you fight starvation and dehydration, you will also need to combat the hostile wilderness filled with unknown predators.<br><br>As you build your tower, it gets easier to defend yourself against other players and the threats of the world. You can't hide away in your fortress forever, though. You will need to travel to other ships to gather, survive and improve. You can always return home to safety... that is, if it was protected well enough. Play solo or team up with a friend to survive together!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">WARNING:</h2> THIS GAME IS EARLY ACCESS ALPHA. PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE IT UNLESS YOU WANT TO ACTIVELY SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT OF THE GAME AND ARE PREPARED TO HANDLE WITH SERIOUS ISSUES AND POSSIBLE INTERRUPTIONS OF GAME FUNCTIONING.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2><br>After the invention of the steam engine, humanity was at the height of its ingenuity, being able to create all sorts of technical wonders.
