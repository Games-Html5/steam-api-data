  "detailed_description": "Defend your island from blood-thirsty pirates! Then set sail for distant lands! Explore the sea for exotic places with strange mechanical vessels and bizarre contraptions built to travel under the water. Many will join your enemy, claiming that you are pirates\u2014that you should be stopped! But you know the truth. Follow your code to protect the weak and remain fearless as darkness falls over the sea. There will be no one else to stand against it.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Win treasure like gold, pirate gear, clockwork contraptions, and relics from the past!<br></li><li>Build the perfect fleet and use it to crush your enemies!<br></li><li>Unlock amazing new ship designs that can turn the tides of Battle!<br></li><li>Liberate dozens of islands spread across a vast ocean!<br></li><li>Take on dangerous missions to hunt notorious pirate captains!<br></li><li>Design your own flag and choose the colors for your fleet!</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Liberate the Islands</h2>The ocean is divided into territories, each of which has islands. As you fight pirates in a territory, you gradually liberate the local islands, which unlocks new locations on each island, new items to buy, and new crew to hire.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Complete Missions</h2>As you explore you may find someone who offers you a mission. Completing missions will unlock locations, unlock new ship designs, or reward you with gold. There\u2019s also always a primary mission that will advance the story.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Hire Your Crew</h2>Occasionally you will find someone willing to join your crew in exchange for gold or items. As your crew grows you can use more ships in combat or choose to use bigger ships, if you\u2019ve discovered their designs.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Collect Items</h2>There\u2019s hundreds of items to find scattered across the ocean! You can sell items for gold or hold on to them to hire potential crew. You might even be able to find a store that will offer you more gold for a certain type of item.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Customize Your Look</h2>Some items allow you to change the look of your fleet, such as fleet color, flag designs, and flag emblems. You can then edit your flag and fleet colors at any island to make the perfect look for your fleet. Or, save your gold to buy ships.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Grow Your Fleet</h2>Ships can be purchased once their designs are discovered. Once you own a ship you can start teaching it new actions by assigning a captain to the ship. Each captain teaches the ship a different action. Actions can gain levels and become unstoppable.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Stop to Fish</h2>You can\u2019t fight pirates all the time! Fishing and botany are both available to help you relax while gaining some valuable items to sell. Mythical fish and plants are out there to discover and are worth a lot of gold. Finding them won\u2019t be easy though.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">One Last Thing</h2>Pirate Code is mostly the work of one bearded programmer. If you have suggestions, I will be listening. Now, shouldn\u2019t you be loading the cannons?",
