Convince people on the streets to go with you, and your power will grow. Go from one man to another to gather them in lines, form columns. When you're done, go to the city square to make a statement.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">UNITED WE STAND</h2>Earn respect of your followers, otherwise you won't be able to continue the fight and bring down the regime. The bigger the columns of angry citizens are, the sooner the people will loose their trust in authorities. The moment the number of your supporters in the central square reaches a critical mass, the hated regime will fall!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FIGHT FOR YOUR FUTURE</h2>Your freedom is in your hands. Lead the revolution to put an end to the corrupted system and change your country!",
