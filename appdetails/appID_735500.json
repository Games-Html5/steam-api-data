Flint is a manly man with a shotgun who is just trying to reach home to save his one true love. But his truck car got totaled, and the way home is blocked by thousands of creepy animals and madmen. What else can he do, but take his gun and find out for himself what the hell is going on!<br><br><strong>Graphics</strong><br>For Creepy Road, we have created a truly mad world with over 30 original kinds of funny and furious enemies, from animals and birds to psychos.

Maybe he\u2019s read The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho, perhaps he likes to listen to Tchaikovsky, and it\u2019s possible he even goes to Dali's artwork for inspiration... He\u2019s mysterious... but one thing\u2019s for certain, he loves to destroy all who dare to stand in his way!<br><br><strong>Weapons</strong><br>You will fight with the usual weapons like the revolver, AK 47, shotgun, minigun, but also with kooky weapons, designed to make gameplay more fun and memorable. <br><br><strong>Huge bosses</strong><br>In Creepy Road, you will meet vicious bosses. Each of them with its own battle style. And one more thing: all bosses in game are incredibly huge. No! We mean really, truly HUMUNGOUS bosses! Stretch your fingers before diving into these epic battles!<br><br><strong>Music</strong><br>Each location in Creepy Road is accompanied by an original musical theme, helping players immerse themselves in the atmosphere of what is happening and setting the rhythm of gameplay. The game contains more than 15 original musical tracks.",
