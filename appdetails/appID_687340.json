Make the right choices at the right times. Work with agents in the field, be their eyes and ears in this extensive real time action puzzle.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Hack and control any device</h2>Hack and control any devices and objects. Spyhack takes you on a digital battle field. Open doors, use cameras, activate equipment, take full control over your surroundings.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Misions around the world</h2>Discover the mystery of Spyhack by taking part on a number of addictive missions. Plan your gameplay path and explore the different corners of the world by participating in various side missions.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Search databases</h2>Be a watchful and perceptive observer to collect important information during the mission. Search the civil and military databases to learn more about your targets. Database can help you to achieve a goal.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Use heavy weapons</h2>Use a variety types of heavy weapons from the military arsenal as a support. Launch a missile strike in the middle of the city or detonate a micro bomb, you decide how to reach your goal. If you prefer to send in the big guns, that's something you can do.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Use advanced technology</h2>Complete missions using the latest technologies. Take control over drones, spy satellites, thermal imaging cameras and other devices.<br><br><br><strong>Agents</strong>: The player becomes an agent who works as a hacker. Player character is rarely the centre of attention, his role is to gain full control of the surroundings. As a talented IT specialist, you hack all devices that can be helpful to the agents in any way. Whereas the agents are controlled by AI, not the player. The characters react to changes in their surroundings (hacked cameras, security alerts issued by the hacker etc.) and communicate with the player through the chatroom. The player must provide the agents with precise, legible and structured information. Otherwise, incorrect or chaotic instructions may lead to mission failure.<br><br><strong>Stealth system</strong>: Not all agents involved in the mission work in the stealth mode. Depending on the scenario, some of them may participate in banquets, drive vehicles etc. Whether an agent is stealth or not depends on their task assigned to a specific mission. The game is flexible and the roles of our sims may change while we play. Stealth agents have predefined AI behaviours and work as best they can, but the success of the mission depends to a large extent by the player. You help the agents by hacking the surroundings, issuing warnings and indicating potentially safest routes.<br><br><strong>Hacking System</strong>: The hacking system will allow the player to gain access to the components they are interested in. Each device in the game is hackable and can be useful. Starting from a photocopier through an electric kettle, to an entire power network! The player can create viruses, use hacking programs and look for any backdoors left in computer systems to take control over electronic devices. Any electronics connected to the network can serve as help to field agents, distraction for the security or a deadly weapon! In addition, you can gather intel through a network of cameras located in buildings, on roads, drones and the agents. Such information increases your hacking and control abilities. Furthermore, a hacker should remember to avoid alarms and that agents keep working in the field and require his attention.",
