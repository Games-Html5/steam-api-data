Become friends or foes with extremely dynamic characters and factions scattered across the many islands.

Fire your cannons, use a harpoon to reel in the enemy ship, and board it for loot and a bigger crew. Lead skirmishes by mastering your dodge and parry skills in an intuitive combat system.

They shipwrecked in The Archipelago where they began to prosper thanks to <strong>Arkanaguno, the volcano god</strong>, who provided them with soil.<br><br>A century later, glaciers formed and the prosperity of the islands was ravaged by frost. Many natives began worshipping <strong>Solwe, the sun god</strong>, in place of Arkanaguno, believing he was angered by their abandonment of him for the volcano god.
