This is one of the first games I created when I began to learn about game development. Pivot was the second entry in my minimalist arcade series.

I have been learning to make games by making games and love creating small-yet-solid arcade games with simple mechanics. <strong>Please expect 'Pivot XL' to be a small, re-playable, arcade score-chaser game where the only basic goals are to constantly beat your previous score and unlock a handful of cosmetic skins for the character.</strong> I greatly appreciate feedback and will do my best to ensure support for my games.
