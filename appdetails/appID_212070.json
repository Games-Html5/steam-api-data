In a major redesign of the game\u2019s progression system, players can now earn experience points and unlock new content by taking part in a story-driven campaign. The update offers beginners a gradual introduction to the game\u2019s warring factions, different ship types, and incrementally increasing complex combat scenarios, while experienced pilots can head directly to more challenging adventures in outer space on new, powerful ships.<br><br>A journey of hundreds light-years begins at the United Mercenary Center, where the player joins a group of elite scouts searching for the missing fleet of the powerful, but enigmatic Ellydium Corporation. While looking for clues on what could have possibly caused an entire fleet of an interstellar conglomerate to vanish without a trace, the player gradually delves deeper into the unknown. <br>Besides the new campaign mode, the \u201cJourney\u201d update adds new top-tier ships, such as the <strong>\u2018Wolfhound\u2019</strong> fighter. Using the \u2018Wounded Beast\u2019 ability, the ship can significantly increase its combat power if the hull is critically damaged. The new command fighter <strong>\u2018Granite\u2019</strong> is capable of protecting itself against both physical damage and hackers\u201cvirtual\u201d damage, as it can use its \u2018Anti-Sabotage 2.1\u2019 ability to prevent enemy hackers from taking over ship control.<br><br>Furthermore, two new space sectors can now be explored in the Star Conflict universe: \u2018PB#42\u2019 is located just above the surface of a planet, where high cliffs provide protection for support ships as fighters can use the cover to flank the enemy\u2019s positions. \u2018Excavation Site #6\u2019 features a similar, but more barren environment. Here, the focus is on long-range engagements, but smaller vessels can still take advantage of the uneven surface.<br><br>Find out more on the official game website!</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Star Conflict is an action-packed, massively multiplayer space simulation game that puts players in the role of elite pilots engaging in a widespread interplanetary skirmish.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The whole world for PVP and PVE!</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>PVP battles on dozens of space locations <br></li><li>PVE missions and quests for groups or lone wolves <br></li><li>Unique sandbox mode with extensive PVP and PVE capabilities <br></li><li>Corporations' battles for influence <br></li><li>More than a hundred ships of various types and purposes <br></li><li>9 tactical roles, hundreds of modules and the possibility of modifying <br></li><li>Production of modules and ships! </li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A Fleet at Your Fingertips<br>Take command of varied battleships, from nimble scouting ships to heavy frigates loaded with guns and rockets.
