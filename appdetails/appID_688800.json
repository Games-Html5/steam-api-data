  "detailed_description": "Paralysis is an asymmetrical (4vs1) first person horror game. In which four survivors use teamwork to evade the player controlled creature. The creature uses it's vision to track down and take out the survivors, while they attempt to outsmart it.<br><br>The goal for the survivors is to find key cards around the map then escape without having the creature find you first. This gives the players surviving a goal to complete instead of just a time objective.<br><br>The game is first person to allow everyone to get a more realistic experience to allow for more scares; The horror genre will be much more prevalent. A 3rd person perspective would allow the players to see around corners, so we made it so that they can only see what the survivor would be able to see.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FEATURES</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Asymmetrical - This means that there will be a 4 versus 1 game play. Where four people play as survivors and one plays as a creature. This allows for a different experience each time, as everyone will play the game differently. This creates many scenarios for both the survivor and the creature. <br><br></li><li> Teamwork? - When surviving in the game the survivors can choose whether or not to work together. The choice is yours. Do you work better alone? Then stay away from your team and find the key cards yourself.<br><br></li><li> Darkness - While you have to be aware of your surroundings with the creature lurking around, you are in complete darkness. You do however have a flashlight, but be smart as any form of light will attract the creature. <br><br></li><li> Silence - While most games use music to build up an atmosphere, we chose to remove it all together. Instead the entire map is silent with the sounds of footsteps. This makes Paralysis more eerie and keeps you on your toes. Be aware of your surroundings.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PLANNED FEATURES</h2><br><strong>We do not promise that the following features will make it into the game. </strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> New Animations<br><br></li><li> New Maps<br><br></li><li> New Gamemodes<br><br></li><li> New Creatures<br><br></li><li> Achievements<br><br></li><li> Sound Overhaul</li></ul>",
