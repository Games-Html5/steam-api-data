Vorug, broke the divine diamond into many fragments and imprisoned them in colored blocks that floated through the five worlds of skulls, including the &quot;Valley of Bones.&quot; With the power of the diamond and floating blocks, Vorug became very strong, casting a spell to make all skulls his servants, including the powerful protective entities from each of the five parallel worlds. The magician DZEN, managed to cast a protection spell itself and by luck, also protected the skull &quot;The Hooligan&quot;. Together, they fled to &quot;The Swamp&quot;, the farthest parallel world of the &quot;Valley of Bones&quot;, where &quot;hooligan&quot; gained powers granted by DZEN, and also, special magic skulls, for the bones to become a huge floating paddle to control the magical skulls to start destroying the floating blocks and weaken Vorug<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is the invitation to the game, which was done with great affection and dedication.",
