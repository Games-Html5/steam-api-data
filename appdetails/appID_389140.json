Each curve and each lap in Horizon Chase Turbo recreates classic arcade gameplay and offers you unbound speed limits of fun. Full throttle on and enjoy!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BACK TO THE OLD-SCHOOL COUCH FRIENDSHIPS</h2>Horizon Chase Turbo offers a Multiplayer Split Screen mode that rescues the nostalgia of playing with your best friends sitting on a couch all night long. The hard time is to know who is your best friend because this one is also the one to be beaten.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">16-bit GRAPHICS REINVENTED</h2>Horizon Chase Turbo brings back the graphics context of the 16-bit generation and creates a style that is inspired in the past without letting go of its contemporaneity. The apparent polygon and secondary color aesthetic accentuate the visual beauty of the game, resulting in a unique and harmonic atmosphere.
