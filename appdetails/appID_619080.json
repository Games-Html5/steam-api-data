An interactive game show in which you and 15 other contestants will be dropped onto La Cuna Island with one simple goal \u2013 <i>Get the hell off La Cuna Island!</i><br> <br>How it works is simple: Find a hidden relic, signal for extraction, and escape on the chopper. How to do it is hard: You\u2019ll have to use your skills <i>and </i>your personality to build alliances, out-scheme opponents, and entertain the audience. There's also the hordes of bloodthirsty monsters to contend with.<br> <br>If you\u2019re lucky enough to survive, you\u2019ll be greeted with fortune <i>and</i> fame.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SURVIVE THE DEADLY COMPETITION</h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/619080/extras/steam-store-header.jpg?t=1521222863\" ><br>Securing your spot on the escape helicopter won't be easy. Hordes of monsters and contestants will try to stop you on your way out. Experiment with various strategies to survive, from gearing up to going alone or forming a team of skilled survivors.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">USE YOUR VOICE TO COMMUNICATE</h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/619080/extras/steam-store-communicate.jpg?t=1521222863\" ><br>Survival is key, but winning isn\u2019t as simple as killing everyone else in the match. Forming ad hoc alliances, and putting your trust in the right people will greatly improve your chances of winning. Communicate with those within shouting distance using your mic, or your gestures!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MAKE ALLIES...AND ENEMIES</h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/619080/extras/betrayal-final.jpg?t=1521222863\" ><br>Of course, those alliances can be....<i>temporary</i>. You may decide that sometimes, betraying your friend and stealing their treasures is the best strategy to win. But remember: every action has a consequence, and it will affect your reputation and infamy. What will you be famous for?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GET THE GEAR</h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/619080/extras/steam-gearup.jpg?t=1521222863\" ><br>Resources on the island are limited. Learn to locate and open loot containers to secure the most coveted weapons and items on the island before others do. If they find them first, you can always use your wits and charms to convince them to trade them or give them to you.

Learn to master shooting, melee and throwing weapons. You can throw pretty much anything at your enemy. Skulls and papayas included.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BEWARE THE MONSTERS</h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/619080/extras/hupia2.jpg?t=1521222863\" ><br>La Cuna is filled with mysterious and deadly creatures. You can avoid them or fight them if you think you have what it takes. Beware of their attacks though: they will infect you if you get too close. If you do not want to turn into a monster yourself, you will need to find an antidote to cure the infection, or eat mushroom to keep it contained while you can.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">IMPRESS THE AUDIENCE</h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/619080/extras/voting.jpg?t=1521222863\" ><br>This is a show, after all, and whether you're a streamer or a gamer, SOS features a real live audience that can affect gameplay. Entertain the crowd, and they might just drop you some much needed resources! You\u2019ll need them when the going gets rough.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PLAY WITH YOUR FRIEND</h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/619080/extras/duo.jpg?t=1521222863\" ><br>Want to play with your Steam friends?
