Travel through countless lands of dreamlike fantasies and solve challenging puzzles. Explore the interpenetrating worlds of dreams and consciousness; be careful not to go astray on the winding paths of the subconscious. Display your cunning, memory skills, and ability to observe in accordance with the traditional rules of a point &amp; click adventure game. During your journey you will meet colorful heroes such as the Onieromancer: a mysterious translator of dreams; Metatron: an archangel of the magical wilderness, or the Horologist of Light: a mysterious old man with an impenetrable face. However, choose your advisors wisely and be careful not to follow false leads. Escape from the house of suffering and embark on a magical journey into the unknown. Journey through the countless lands of sleep and see if fate will be kind to little Lucy.<br><br><strong>Plot Summary: </strong>Confined to her wheelchair, little Lucy enters a world of dream fantasies and nightmares, facing the ghosts of the demons of her past. Tragically deprived of her father, the girl tries to save the only person who remains close to her: her ailing mother, all while fighting for her own soul. Time is not her ally; every shed tear brings her closer to the land of oblivion. <br><br><strong>The Game World: </strong>You will travel with us to myriad worlds of surreal fantasy, where the bounds of physics cease to apply; but you will also return to the overwhelming weight of reality.<br><br><strong>Puzzles to Solve:</strong> Awaken the eternal dream of the Soothsayer, release the lost soul of a traveling stranger, surrender to divine judgment; the puzzles in Lucid Dream are not only challenges that stimulate creativity, but are also, perhaps above all else, magic and symbolism woven into dozens of puzzles and tasks, providing a satisfying adventure.<br><br><strong>Graphics:</strong> The hand-drawn graphics in Lucid Dream are more than just a background for the game, they are the realization of the emotions and fears of the main character, and make the gaming experience more immersive, complete, and intense.<br><br><strong>Music:</strong> There are certain melodies that lodge in our memory for a long time, inseparably connecting our recollections of the game with their sound. If you would like to find out for yourself, play Lucid Dream and set sail with us on a magical journey.<br><br><strong>Interface:</strong> Read between the lines of the stories told by heroes that you will encounter on your way, pore over every object and every thing. In the dream world, not everything will be as it appears. Let the fantasy lead you, combine objects, and create solutions that are not available in the gray world of reality.",
