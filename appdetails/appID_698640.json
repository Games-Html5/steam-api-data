  "reviews": "\u201cHeavily inked and consumingly gritty, it's as much Mignola as it is Darkest Dungeon, but with neat sci-fi flare.\u201d<br><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/turn-based-roguelike-deep-sky-derelicts-channels-darkest-dungeon-in-space/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >PC Gamer</a></a><br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s all comicbook-styled, in a vaguely 2000ADish manner, with large, characterful sprites and nice XIII-style panel-in-panel animations so show e.g. killing moves. Looks great, and does a fine job of mingling turn-based squad combat with survival elements.\u201d<br><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/11/17/best-new-steam-indie-games/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Rock, Paper, Shotgun</a></a><br><br>\u201cDeep Sky Derelicts has got your roguelite.
