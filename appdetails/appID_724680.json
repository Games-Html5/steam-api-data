With hard work and a bit of luck, you\u2019ll be well on your way to owning the most popular attraction along Route 66 Million!<br><br><br><strong><u>Expansive Campaign Mode</u></strong><br><br>Starting with your Uncle Cosmo's failing space gas station, you'll have to work your way up to having the best tourist trap in the galaxy. As you get better at the game, you'll gain access to an ever-increasing variety of amenities for your customers to enjoy, as well as ways to upgrade and expand your ship. Although your Uncle Cosmo is taking a little vacation from running the Quickstop, he may check in from time to time to make sure things are running smoothly. <br><br><br><strong><u>Swappable Amenities</u></strong><br><br>Each amenity comes with it's own bizarre perks and challenges. Not a fan of the gift shop? Swap it at the end of the day for an animatronic band to entertain your customers for a while!

Individually, each mini-game is quick and simple, but as customers pour in, you will find yourself frantically juggling these easy tasks.  Whether it be dodging asteroids, pumping gas, or even just cleaning the glorp rooms, the game never stops throwing new stuff at you.<br><br><br><strong><u>Get a High Score!</u></strong><br><br>Test your skills with two extra play modes. We have score attack mode, where you're trying to get the highest score in a set amount of time. Endurance mode lets you fight against the clock to play as long as you can.",
