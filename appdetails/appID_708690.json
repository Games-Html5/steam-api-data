Visuals, sound effects and level design are subject to change and are still work in progress. The demo is very stable and has been tested on a number of systems, however, this doesn't mean there won't be any bugs or glitches; if you do manage to 'break' the game, please feel free to get in contact and let me me know! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou play as Steve, the wizards apprentice. You have been imbued with abilities and super strength; not bad for a once, rusty pile of armour! You must battle your way through the varying levels, collecting the broken shards of  what we once called home. Along the way, you will encounter enemies from other dimensions, that are interested in one thing and one thing only.....to destroy what's left of the world. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe world needs a hero. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCan you be that hero?",
