On the field, he is very versatile.<br>- <strong>ICY</strong>: As cold as cute, she is great at demolishing ice blocks, but not so great against wood or stone.<br>- <strong>WOODY</strong>: The woodcutter of the group, he is great at demolishing wood blocks, but not so great against ice or stone.<br>- <strong>ROCKY</strong>: As solid as a rock, he is great at demolishing stone blocks, but not so great against ice or wood.<br>- <strong>BOMBY</strong>: Explosive! Once out on the field, touching anything will trigger his 3 seconds timer before he blows up.<br>- <strong>RUSHY</strong>: Agile and fast, if she gets in a 2 meters radius from a target, she will rush at it!<br>- <strong>SWATTY</strong>: Big and strong, when he gets right above a target, he will swat it! It can even break gold when it swats.<br>- <strong>WEEDY</strong>: A zen ball of leaves, his talent? Crossing grass or leaves!<br>- <strong>BADDY</strong>: Hmmm... what to say? They are just... bad!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE WEAPONS</h2>In <strong>VR Furballs - Demolition</strong>, you will unlock <strong>Weapons</strong> along the way:<br>- <strong>SLINGSHOT</strong>: A precise and powerful weapon.<br>- <strong>SPORTING EQUIPMENT</strong>: <strong>Tennis Racket</strong>, <strong>Baseball Bat</strong> and <strong>Golf Club</strong>.<br>- <strong>GUN</strong>: A precious weapon that will greatly help you defeat King Baddy.<br>- <strong>CONTROLLERS</strong>: Yeah, it's kind of a weapon if you're good at throwing.<br>- <strong>HEAD</strong>: Did you know you can also do headers?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE ACCESSORIES</h2>In <strong>VR Furballs - Demolition</strong>, you will also unlock <strong>Accessories</strong>:<br>- <strong>RADAR</strong>: It will scan the area to show you where the Baddies are.<br>- <strong>DRONES</strong>: They let you place your Furball precisely, very useful to prepare the perfect shot.<br>- <strong>CAMERA</strong>: Selfie!!! Beware... those photos will auto-destroy if you don't frame them! But don't worry, they are all preciously saved on your computer.<br>- <strong>BULLET TIME</strong>: Slowing down time for a couple of seconds can be very powerful! So powerful that it will need a few seconds to recharge.<br>- <strong>MUSHROOMS</strong>: Pink for small, Blue for big. Just eat them you tiny giant!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE MINI-GAMES</h2>Take a break from demolishing. In <strong>VR Furballs - Demolition</strong>, you'll have 6 more ways to let off steam:<br>- <strong>SHOOTING RANGE</strong>: Shoot as many targets as possible in 60 seconds.<br>- <strong>HIT THE BOMB</strong>: Hit the bombs the drones are throwing at you. The fifth you miss will be the last.<br>- <strong>WHACK-A-MOLE</strong>: Whack as many fake Baddies you can in 60 seconds. Please don't whack the nice Swatties.<br>- <strong>BASKETBALL</strong>: Score as many baskets as you can in 60 seconds.<br>- <strong>GOBLET TOSS</strong>: Throw Weedy on the colorful goblets.

Follow the instructions on the table in the Construction area. The upload function will come later. In the meantime, send us your creations by email, as explained in the Construction area.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ACHIEVEMENTS AND LEADERBOARDS</h2>If you love replayability and challenge, <strong>VR Furballs - Demolition</strong> is for you! Finishing the levels with the <strong>Slingshot</strong> was easy? Getting the 3 Stars of all the levels wasn't challenging enough? Then try to finish the levels using only one weapon!

And if you like fame, try to keep your name in as many Leaderboards as you can!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE MAKING OF</h2><strong>VR Furballs - Demolition</strong> was developed from the ground up for Virtual Reality.  It is powered by Unreal Engine 4. It is the fruits of the labor of one passionate video game developer, who, during almost a year, went through the design, programming, modeling, animating, audio design, visual effects, polishing, debugging, tweaking, balancing, and now marketing phases all by himself. Hopefully you will enjoy the result!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">WINDOWS MIXED REALITY HEADSETS SUPPORT</h2><strong>VR Furballs - Demolition</strong> has been tested on the Lenovo Explorer Windows Mixed Reality headset, and should work fine on any Windows Mixed Reality headset. However, this platform differs from the others because:<br>- The controllers you will see in your hands are the HTC Vive Controllers<br>- The controllers you will see on the Tutorial panels are the HTC Vive Controllers<br>- The controllers vibration is not supported yet (due to a limitation of the Windows Mixed Reality SteamVR integration)<br>Proper Windows Mixed Reality controllers will be integrated in the game during the Early Access period.",

Gamily Studios has managed to take that core gameplay loop from Angry Birds and make it work in VR. VR Furballs \u2013 Demolition is quite possibly the best version of this videogame genre available for VR headsets today and it\u2019s not even finished yet.\u201d<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.vrfocus.com/tag/vr-furballs-demolition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >VR Focus</a></a><br><br>\u201cAt first glance VR Furballs \u2013 Demolition may look like a VR clone of Angry Birds.
