Rocket Worldwide's and its suppliers' entire liability and your exclusive remedy shall be, at Rocket Worldwide's option, either (a) return of the price paid, if any, or (b) repair or replacement of the software that does not meet Rocket Worldwide's Limited Warranty and which has been removed the hard disk of your computer with a copy of your receipt.

You hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state courts sitting in Delaware or the federal courts in Deleware to resolve any disputes arising under this EULA. In each case this EULA shall be construed and enforced without regard to the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n14)\tCOMPLETE AGREEMENT.

You agree that any varying or additional terms contained in any purchase order or other written notification or document issued by you in relation to the Software licensed hereunder shall be of no effect. The failure or delay of Rocket Worldwide to exercise any of its rights under this EULA or upon any breach of this EULA shall not be deemed a waiver of those rights or of the breach. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n15)\tSEVERABILITY. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of the EULA, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the EULA shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this EULA shall continue in full force and effect.",
