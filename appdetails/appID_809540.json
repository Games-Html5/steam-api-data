  "reviews": "\u201cIt\u2019s a fun and addictive fusion of tower defense and kaiju blasting arcade action that shows a lot of potential. The pixel artwork is excellent, there\u2019s a nice selection of upgrades and the gameplay is fast and frantic .\u201d<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.alphabetagamer.com/mechs-v-kaijus-beta-demo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Alpha Beta Gamer</a></a><br><br>\u201c...I am a fan of feeling awesome. MVK\u2019s premise is a quick and dirty way to generate that feeling, but it has a few tricks up its sleeve to help. The best moments, though, are when you summon your defences from the skies. Time slows as you open the building menu, and each wall and turret slams into the ground instantly via a drop pod: there\u2019s no faffing around with build times.\u201d<br><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/02/16/mechs-v-kaijus-has-an-awesome-tower-defence-theme/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Rock Paper Shotgun</a></a><br>",
