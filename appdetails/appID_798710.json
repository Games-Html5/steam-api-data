Seems that something has gone badly wrong and it's full of enemies (we don't reveal what kind of..). This level gives you about a 60-120 min gameplay, the game proceeds straightforwardly when you explore different parts of Star Cruiser and you desperate to escape..<br><br><strong>Level 2: VoltageDinoLand:</strong> Dinos have escaped from their cages! This level gives you about a 30-100 min gameplay, depends how much are you going to explore the DinoLand and complete your mission.<br><br><strong>Level 3: City of Voltage:</strong> Something calls us in the middle of the city.. In this level you explore suburbs and the main city. It gives you a 30-100 min gameplay.<br><br>Currently it is not possible to move back to previous map (for example if you enter to level 3 you cant go back to level 2), since the storyline is going a straight line, but we are planing to implement that feature in future.

That maneuver opened a portal (which can be used only for sending small mass objects or voice), and hence deliver AOSYS to our dimension. For you all to play.
