Simple and smart game-play, ideal for short periods of time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGAME OBJECTIVE:<br />\r\nYou must make groups of 3 or more with the same fruits/items in any direction! Move the fruits up or down with the mouse or click the lever and spin them all. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWATCH OUT:<br />\r\nEvery time you move a fruit your life bar drops, and every time you match fruits your bar rises. If your life bar empties, you lose. If it fills all the way to the top, you get a level up and play with new and more valuable fruits. Simple but super addictive! Also, try to match multiple fruits at the same time. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMODES:<br />\r\nEasy: Take your time and have fun.<br />\r\nHard: For those who like frantic fun!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCaution: This is a smart puzzle game, NOT a casino game. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFEATURES<br />\r\n\u25b6 Super addictive: play once and that\u2019s it...<br />\r\n\u25b6 Very fast gameplay (a game can last a mere 10 seconds).<br />\r\n\u25b6 Designed for Full HD computers.<br />\r\n\u25b6 Free Cloud Sync (*not obligatory).
