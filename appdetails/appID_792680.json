If you have any feedback about the game whatsoever, then please don't hesitate to post a message on the Steam forums. I hope you'll enjoy playing the game, as it has been a labor of love(and lots of frustration). You can expect some free updates that will include new content(weapons/maps), so please don't hesitate to make your opinion known on the forums!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you are thinking about buying this game, then I will give you the two primary reasons for doing so:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou have a friend who owns the VR version of Containment Initiative(arguably the best version) and you want to play as their support sniper in online co-op.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOR<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou just really like watching zombies heads blow up in slow motion and getting money for new and improved gear by doing this repeatedly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nContainment Initiative is a simple game about shooting zombies in the face and earning money for doing it. As you earn money, you can buy better guns. Some levels allow you to roam around and collect supply crates that are traded in for cash, while other levels will have you perched up in a high position and allow you to shoot at zombies without worrying about them hitting you back.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCurrently, there are six maps to play through with each differing in difficulty.",
