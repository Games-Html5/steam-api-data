It is our passion to deliver that experience that has been missing in the genre.  No more high fantasy, dark fantasy or voxel settings.  Just good old fashioned Sci-Fi awesomesauce. <br><br></li><li> Targeting Overlay - It can be frustrating at times to not have visual indicators for how far your skills work.  We sought to solve this with a toggle-able targeting overlay that displays your skills range and area of effect.<br><br></li><li>  Healthy Player Mechanics - Being a gamer in 2017 is hard.  There are so many good games and so little time it can be hard to pull yourself away.  We feel that as developers it is part of our ethical duty to encourage gamers to make healthy choices.
