  "detailed_description": "A classic gaming experience. Shadowcrawl is a Roguelike that is like no other, an attempt at taking one of gamings greatest and oldest genres and improving upon it with modern design principles. Fight your way through an infinite, interdimensional dungeon against overwhelming odds. Hunt for alien technology and conquer gods, all while using superior strategy to outsmart and defeat hundreds of enemies at a time. How long can you survive? <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/757730/extras/ShadowcrawlInroScreen1.png?t=1521417846\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">HIGHLY DEVELOPED ROGUELIKE</h2><br>Fight over 100 different enemy types as you work your way through the dungeon, each with different ranks and roles. Defeat high ranking enemies quickly before they have a chance to mass an army for a counter-attack.<br><br>Find secret bosses, rare-spawn monsters &amp; complete quests to permanently add new weapons, enemies, shrines &amp; more to the level generator. Join powerful cults to gain new perks and powers. You can even worship some beings in secret without violating existing pacts, if you don't get caught.<br><br>Shadowcrawl is less about luck or collecting loot than it is strategy As you accumulate perks and abilities your character will take on traits that let them adapt more effectively to different features of the maze generator, forcing you to think strategically at all times about where you are standing and where you are going. <br><br>Most players know many moves ahead of time if they are going to die once they learn how to read the battlefield. You are constantly being swarmed by hundreds, even THOUSANDS of enemies at a time must think on your feet to survive.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DEEP CHARACTER BUILDING</h2><br>Character experience is maintained between deaths &amp; character builds are deep but easy to make and remake. Besides simply leveling up, your choices, Gods, and allegiances throughout the game will also grant you access to new perks, abilities and more.<br><br>Mix &amp; Match Melee, Ranged, and Stealth specializations in various combinations to create builds with unique playstyles. A stealth-oriented mage can get up to 8 stealth-kills in a single attack if played cleverly. <br><br>Your character class changes dynamically as you update your build and gain access to new playstyles.

As a Demon it is effective to play in an underhanded manner or should you be turned into a mindless monster then your character is forced to berserk or die.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">STEALTH</h2><br>Some perks and classes will grant your character the ability to hide in the shadows. This enhances the lighting effects and makes the player hard to detect or even undetectable in low lighting conditions. Sneak past tough enemies and perform devastating attacks from the shadows.
