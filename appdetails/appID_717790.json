Players interact with smart and complete AI hunters and animals to claim resources and expand building capabilities. Since launching, we've added quests and more islands and expanded the map. <br><br><br>We wanted to make a survival game that\u2019s not about feeling like you are on the verge of dying, while fighting off and defending your base. In Hold Your Own it\u2019s easier to find food and water, but AI is harder to kill and coming after you. We want players to have fun, build their base so they can spend their time on fun quests and killing AI.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Key Features</strong>: </h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Island map exploration and Snow Biome (5 new islands)<br></li><li>Character Hunger, Thirst, Body Temperature Mechanics <br></li><li>Base Building<br></li><li>Ferry Mechanics to travel from one island to another<br></li><li>Hunting <br></li><li>Crafting Items<br></li><li>Food Cooking Mechanics<br></li><li>Power/Electricity Mechanics<br></li><li>Gathering Resources <br></li><li>Mining and refining of ores<br></li><li>Quests<br></li><li>Trader<br></li><li>Arms Dealer<br></li><li>Kill AI Enemies <br></li><li>Animal Husbandry <br></li><li>Farming<br></li><li>Day/Night Cycle<br></li><li>Weather Cycle </li></ul><br><br>The graphics and quality of the game are our most important priority during Early Access. We know that all the features in the world can\u2019t attract players if the game keeps crashing. So while we\u2019re starting in single-player, our goal is to keep evolving and strengthening the systems to be ready for multiplayer eventually. <br><br>We\u2019re ready to launch and will be putting out regular updates and any unforeseen bug fixes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Important Disclaimer</strong>: </h2>We are a small team of 2 and working hard to get Hold Your Own out into the world, but its important to mention that a lot of features we're planning aren't there yet. So only support this game if you are willing to<u> bear with us</u> (and want to kill bears as well) and believe in what we're trying to accomplish.  Which is to say that, at the end of this long road ahead, we're going to make a game that is a different take on the whole survival genre. We will be depending on the community to give us feedback about what's working and what's not, and thank you in advance for giving us a shot!",
