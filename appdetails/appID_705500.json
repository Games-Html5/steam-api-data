Fill bubbles with colored air and push nearby bubbles around using the physics of pressure and surface tension. Break edges between neighbors and mix colors to create matches of 4 or more. Make moves in real-time with a Tetris-like queue that lets you build up cascading chain reactions.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">170+ Handmade Puzzles</h2>Experience deep gameplay with surprising new challenges down every path. Each puzzle requires new thinking and twisting strategies. Play three game types in 7 worlds: puzzle, arcade, and infinity.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Lifelike Soap Bubble Physics</h2>Based on the unique artistic vision of designer Stu Denman and his world-renowned scientist grandfather Cyril Stanley Smith, the game brings to life the beauty of nature to your screen. Incredibly fluid Molecular Dynamics Engine animates bubbles at 60 FPS.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Relaxing And Atmospheric</h2>Adaptive ambient music gracefully integrates with the satisfying sounds of popping. Put on a pair of headphones and get your brain in the zen-zone.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mesmerizing Creatures</h2>Save microscopic aquatic creatures that are trapped in the bubbles. Avoid greedy jelly crabs and spiky urchins. A curious fish named &quot;bloop&quot; will reveal your nature as an optimist or a pessimist.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Awesome Powerups</h2>Are the puzzles too challenging? Earn wild bubbles by making longer chains. Additional bonuses for collecting the right colors and making matches of 7 or longer. Earn color shufflers, boundary expanders and other powerups to use just at the right moment for epic wins!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Colorblind Mode</h2>Featuring an innovative colorblind mode that provides an authentic experience without intrusive icons or patterns.",
