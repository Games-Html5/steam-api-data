  "detailed_description": "Seeing players smile as you hand them two giant pizza paddles never gets old. Sending a beach ball sailing over the hills is a magical VR moment, and we're casually developing Beach Ball Valley to share that with everyone. While it's primarily enjoyed in demos by younger audience, my Mom and Grandmother, it's highly tuned haptics &amp; physics feel lovely. Professional business executives have lost themselves to the simple playfulness, and exclaimed &quot;This is more fun than a room full of puppies!&quot;<br><br>Beach Ball Valley is a timeless, hand crafted, free range, beach ball preserve. <br>You and your giant pizza peel* hands are invited to spend some time in the sun, batting beach balls, pilling 'em up, and just watching them roam around the countryside.<br><br>*(that's what a pizza paddle is officially called I guess)<br><br>There's apparently a game mode where you've got one minute to hit them through hoops for points and stuff. That's included in case people don't understand how fun just hitting beach balls around it. It keeps score for about 100 or 200 of your rounds (but doesn't save it!) in case you want to run it at a party and track high scores. Oh, did I mention that if you can use telekinetic powers in it, you can wow your friends?<br><br>But wait, there's more! There's a music game where you can tap in a tempo and hit beach balls along with any music you like, and a goalie game where you defend from an avalanche of 50 beach balls!<br><br>Since demos usually have many people waiting, we've added keys to play with and alter the world. I'll often let children play with their parents, swarm them with beach balls, and other silly things. <br><br>If two paddles &amp; your head isn't enough, equip up to 9 tracker pucks for paddles on your elbows, feet, or anywhere you can affix them. (We do not take responsibility for trackers affixed to your cat.)<br><br>Frequently Unasked Questions:<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Why pizza peels?</h2>I like pizza. Also, they're great for reach out really far and hitting things. They also hit stuff really hard!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Is there a Beach?</h2>There is not a beach. These are inland meadow beach balls.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Do the beach balls mind being hit?</h2>Every beach ball dreams of flight, and their thick rubbery carapaces are suited for rapid acceleration.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How many beach balls can I have?</h2>Once there are 100 beach balls, scientists believe they could develop a sentient network as well as flight capabilities. They'll head off planet in search of dull worlds in need of fun. The static electricity given off by beach balls may cause a spike in microburst storm systems. Sadly, 1% of beach balls are anti-social, and often leave.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Why are the clouds eating my beach balls?</h2>Fredricko the Cloud believes that due to the non-biodegradable nature of beach balls, it's his duty to clean up after anyone who's made too many beach balls. He's also hungry. He's the one by the small hill, not to be confused with Gerando or Luis.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What's the Difference between seated / standing / roomscale?</h2>Beach Balls come to you.
