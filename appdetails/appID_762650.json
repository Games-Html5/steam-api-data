You start in a procedurally generated world with only one carriage full of resources into your adventure.<br>Select a suitable place for your first settlement and procure building materials from mother nature or by trading to create a new home country for your residents. The happier your residents are, the faster your town will grow.<br>Supply your residents with food and water, so that they won't starve or die of thirst. Protect them against the weather and against illnesses by supplying them with clothes and fire wood.<br><br>You will have to face numerous dangers. Storms, illnesses and bandits will strike at you, and also your own residents can become a danger, if you do not meet their needs.

Their basic needs are hunger and thirst which you can satisfy with food and water. In addition, every population type needs another food source. If your population type experiences a shortage of food and the preferential food is not available, you can nourish them with an alternative food source - however, this will affect the mood of your residents in a negative way. Unhappy residents commit raids and other criminal offenses or simply leave the town.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/762650/extras/banner2.png?t=1523274996\" ><br><br>The happier the residents of your town are, the more popular life in your town will become and more and more colonist will join you. If your town experiences famines, illnesses or lawlessness, the residents of the town will turn their backs and the streets will resemble a ghost town.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dangers</h2>The Wild West is dangerous! Dozens of challenges must be faced. There are different areas in which your residents can settle down - however, each of them is known for its own challenges. While in the desert the food and water supply remains a difficulty, in the snowy areas you can only resist by a constant supply with fire wood.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/762650/extras/banner3.png?t=1523274996\" ><br><br>Another danger comes from the surrounding animals.
