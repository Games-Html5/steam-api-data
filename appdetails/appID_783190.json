The game will provide you a roster of 12 heroes, each with his/hers own story, unique specialization and battle abilities. You will build your team of 3 and send them to fight seven deadly sins, depicted as dreadful and ruthless monsters: Pride, Envy, Wrath, Sorrow, Greed, Gluttony and Lust. Each of those sins rule their own realm, so every location that player will visit will differ from others. Same with creatures, that inhabit these lands. Furthermore, these locations will be procedurally generated every time you play to provide you with new experience.<br>But don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t have to slash monsters indefinitely. You will be able to rest from the battles in the Old Church - the last refuge of the sinners - on the crossroads between the warring realms. Here, in the specially equipped place, you\u2019ll be able to change the equipment, learn new skills, switch heroes in your team, get new tasks from other undead, or just have a good sleep in the safe area.<br>But player, be aware - wherever you go your sins will follow.<br><br>In this game we tried to take several interesting game mechanics and ideas from various games and unify them.
