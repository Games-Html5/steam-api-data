  "detailed_description": "<strong>Introduction</strong><br>Odyssey VR is a story driven space adventure single/multiplayer game experience that you can play on Desktop or in Virtual Reality (VR). The environment allows the explorer to experience different tasks in a spaceship. The tasks include locating and handling different tools and protecting the spaceship from asteroid fields. At the end of the playable experience, the explorer can review their performance and improve their personal or social score by playing again. The game is multi-modal and allows explorers to learn interesting facts about space through narrative and audio.<br><br>A maximum of three explorers per session can experience a post-apocalyptic world after the Earth became unable to sustain life. Be a crew member of a large space station inhabited by a group of scientists in search of a new home. The scientists hope to preserve parts of the Earth\u2019s biodiversity in isolated ecosystem bubbles connected to the station. You must protect the ecosystem bubbles, because they carry the last remaining plants and animals from Earth. Travel through space and look for the answers, because humanity is counting on you.<br><br><strong>Controls</strong><br>The experience works both in desktop and Virtual Reality using HTC VIVE. There is an in-game option to switch between the two versions. The experience is fully functional using either one. However, there are slight differences in movement controls and user interactions.<br><br><strong>Development of Odyssey VR</strong><br>This indie adventure experience was developed and will develop along the way. It was developed mostly at the Virtual Reality Association in Helsinki, who donated working spaces and an opportunity to develop, test and gather feedback for the experience. Now, we would like to receive feedback, to learn and do better. We believe that outer space and science is something we all could participate in, do research for, dream about, travel to, and wonder about. May the eternal flame guide you!",
