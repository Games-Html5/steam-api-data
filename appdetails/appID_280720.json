Dig for ideon crystals, pacify riots, research technologies and constructs and maximize your growth while maintaining a healthy ecosystem.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Allies, Threats &amp; Enemies</h2><br>Get ready to deal with threats like asteroid strikes, twisters, wild fires, volcanoes and rising sea levels. Fend off space raiders and alien investors. Coexist and trade with natives, merchants and hostile colonies.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Capitalist Space Age</h2><br>In 2048 huge corporations have divided Earth among themselves and exploited its natural resources to a large extent.
