Unfortunately for the town of Triboar on the Sword Coast, their celebrations are interrupted by the arrival of a githyanki raiding party...<br><br>Greengrass is our tenth limited-time event, running from today until Tuesday, April 24th at noon PDT, and introducing Nrakk, the Githzerai Monk!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/627690/extras/Newsletter_Apr11_Champion.png?t=1523570497\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New Champion: Nrakk</h2><br>Having watched your party's progress for many years from Limbo, the Great Githzerai, Zaerith Menyar-Ag-Gith, has dispatched Nrakk to join your party on the Material Plane. Though his true motivations are unknown, Nrakk is a Way of the Kensei monk whose weapon of choice is a Naginata, making him a true force to be reckoned with on the battlefield. Reserved and aloof, Nrakk sometimes has a hard time interacting with those he sees as his lessers, but he nevertheless seems committed to the party's cause.<br><br>When you want to add Nrakk to your party, you can swap him with Delina or Hitch.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/627690/extras/Newsletter_Apr11_Adventures.png?t=1523570497\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Greengrass Variants</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Whispers \u2014 The Elder Brain slowly drives your Champions mad.

When they reach 100+ stacks, they are stunned for 15 seconds.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Flower Power \u2014 Sentient flower enemies spawn at random in non-boss areas. When killed, they imbue the champion who killed them with a random power, which can be good or bad.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Unlikely Allies \u2014 Two Githzerai monks take up slots in the formation. Each increases the DPS of Nrakk by 400% as long as he is adjacent to them, stacking multiplicatively.</li></ul><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/627690/extras/Newsletter_Apr11_Features.png?t=1523570497\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Added the Greengrass event, our tenth limited-time campaign event!

People don brightly-colored and garish clothing, dancing in the street like court jesters and competing with one another to see who can pull off the most foolish (yet harmless) pranks.<br><br>During the festivities a concerned villager approaches the party and asks for help. She says that her husband's prank is to try and taunt a frost giant...<br><br>Festival of Fools is our ninth limited-time event for Idle Champions, which starts today, lasts until Tuesday, April 10th at noon PDT, and introduces Strix, the Tiefling Sorcerer!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/627690/extras/Newsletter_Mar28_Champion.png?t=1523570497\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New Champion: Strix</h2><br>The Sorcerer known as Strix is from Sigil, the City of Doors at the center of the multiverse. Very little is known of Strix's heritage, even to herself, but it was recently discovered that she was a powerful member of the Skizzicks family, who long ago made a pact with Asmodeus, ruler of the Nine Hells, to become Tieflings.<br><br>Strix is careful, suspicious, and paranoid. She assumes the worst in everyone and is always ready to run away or hide. She lacks basic manners and maintains poor personal hygiene, exemplified by the collection of filthy oddities she hoards within her robes, including snacks which she refers to as &quot;snicketty snooks.&quot;<br><br>As a child, Strix witnessed a shadowy creature slaughter her friends at the bakery where she worked, but was spared for unknown reasons. Her survivor's guilt drives her to try and help those in need, no matter the personal cost.<br><br>When you want to add Strix to your party, you can swap her with Jamilah.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/627690/extras/Newsletter_Mar28_Variants.png?t=1523570497\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Festival of Fools Variants</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Foolish Variance \u2014 Champions randomly do between 0.1% and 199.9% of their actual damage with each hit.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Persistent Foolishness \u2014 The Drunken Fool appears randomly in non-boss areas. Only one can be spawned at a time, but he has special abilities each time he appears:<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Makes all other enemies invulnerable until he is defeated. (16 hits)<br></li><li>Causes all other enemies to move 4x faster than normal until he is defeated. (normal health)<br></li><li> Has a boss health multiplier. (50x)</li></ul></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Like Father Like Son \u2014 The farmer's son takes up a slot in the formation. He moves to a new slot every 25 areas. Every 15 seconds (in non-boss areas) the farmer's son foolishly summons a Frost Giant to attack the formation unless Strix is adjacent to him.</li></ul><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/627690/extras/Newsletter_Mar28_Features.png?t=1523570497\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Added the Festival of Fools event, our ninth limited-time campaign event!

He lived a typical gnomish childhood: tinkering with mechanical toys, pulling pranks on unsuspecting neighbors, and exploring the woodlands covering the mountains in the company of a local dwarf ranger, Galor Rockshield.<br><br>A grizzled veteran of many battles, Galor was waging a secret battle against a clan of drow who were holed up in some deep caves near the village. He carefully struck from the shadows, attempting to drive them back into the Underdark. One night, after a particularly prolonged encounter, a drow scout followed Galor home, and on the night of the next new moon the drow and their minions descended upon the village in force. Galor saved Zorbu's life, but many others were killed, including Zorbu's parents. From that day forth, Zorbu trained under Galor as a ranger, vowing revenge upon the drow and any who claim allegiance to them.<br><br>Cunning and imaginative, Zorbu makes use of his tinkering skills to wield an impossibly large crossbow (named Thunderbolt, which is also Zorbu's nickname) and unleash clever mechanical traps against his foes.<br><br>When you want to add Zorbu to your party, you can swap him with Arkhan.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/627690/extras/Newsletter_Mar7_Variants.png?t=1523570497\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fleetswake Variants</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Thunder and Lightning \u2014 A crazy storm blows in, affecting all outdoor areas. In addition to the wind and rain, lightning strikes your formation every 5 seconds, dealing 90% of max health unavoidable damage to a random Champion. When Zorbu &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; Natten is hit by the effect, his next normal attack does 10x damage.<br></li><li>Crashing Waves \u2014 Only two of your formation's columns do damage at a time. Columns change every 10 areas. Start with back two (slots 4-9), then middle two (slots 2-6), then front two (slots 0-3), then front and back (0-1 &amp; 7-9), then repeat.<br></li><li>The Shipwright's Ball \u2014 Two Shipwrights take up slots (2, 9) in the formation.

Suddenly, a battered and frightened rogue \u2013 in the midst of grappling with a giant spider \u2013 lands with a crash on the table!<br><br>After Bruenor readily dispatches the spider, the rogue tells his tale of adventuring gone wrong. Having barely escaped with his life, the rogue requests your help in rescuing his companions or at least discovering their fate. He'll even split the treasure with you!<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Variant: Wet Feet \u2014 Champions have a random chance on each attack to step in the swamp, getting &quot;wet feet&quot; and reducing their attack speed by 50% for three attacks.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Supply Run</h2><br>A gnome merchant approaches the group. He's Zook Timbers, proprietor of <i>Strakeln &amp; Timbers General Goods and Curious Oddities</i>, and he needs your help!

You'll need to read the change log or the developer blog for the most details, but the gist of the update is that chests are way better now! They drop more things you needs, fewer things you don't, and there are more bonuses for purchasing packs!<br><br>We hope you enjoy this update, which is the first of a series of major systems updates planned for early 2018.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Added the &quot;Truly Neutral Weekend&quot; buff, which boosts the power of several neutrally aligned Champions until Monday, February 26th at noon PST.<br></li><li>Added a new set of Champion upgrades; players should be able to push through another 20-25 areas. Note: due to the upcoming tanking and healing changes, these new upgrades do not include additional health or healing bonuses for tanks or healers.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Clarification (no actual change):</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Clarification regarding the chests update: Chests will always attempt to drop at least one upgraded equipment card if one is available (without adjusting the rarity of the items in the chest); it is not guaranteed that this upgrade will be of the highest rarity the chest drops, and only one upgrade is guaranteed (if possible).<br></li><li>Examples for Gold Chests: It's possible (though extremely unlikely) to get a green upgrade in the same chest you get two purple duplicates (if you had a white or empty slot available); it's also possible (but still unlikely) to get a green upgrade in the same chest as a blue duplicate, even if you have blue upgrades available. The upgrade is not guaranteed to be blue or better, and you are not guaranteed to get more than one upgrade per chest.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Balance Changes:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Ultimate cooldown reduction equipment items have been rebalanced. Epic gear now reduces the cooldown by 1/4th of the base cooldown, rare by 1/10th, uncommon by 1/20th, and common by 1/40th. This was done in order to make it so that shiny and golden c/d reduction epics do not instantly cap your Champions' ultimate c/d at level 1 and also to give value to players whose c/d reduction items have already leveled up from receiving duplicates or using blacksmithing contracts. Note: in some cases this rebalancing resulted in an *increase* to the c/d reduction on lower rarity items.<br></li><li>Ultimate cooldown reduction equipment items now have a max level. After an item is at or above max level, no more of those items will appear in chests (unless they are an upgrade or a shiny item), and that slot will not be a valid target for blacksmithing contracts. For the existing set of c/d reduction items, the max level varies based on the gild level of the item. Normal = 501, Shiny = 251, Golden = 126. These max levels apply to all rarities, so a maxed out non-epic item will not necessarily provide maxed out c/d reduction.<br></li><li>For players whose c/d reduction items are already above these levels, or whose items exceed the max level in the future due to an upgraded gild level, we are planning to create a system to automatically distribute those extra levels among other items owned by that hero, however we do not have an ETA on that system.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Changes:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Clarified the wording of the &quot;Epically Geared&quot; Kelemvor blessing.</li></ul><br>For more information, check out our in-game Change Log!</p><br><h1>Early Access Update #22: Grand Revel</h1><p><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/627690/extras/Newsletter_Feb14_BannerBig.png?t=1523570497\" ><br><br>In the Forgotten Realms, Grand Revel is a day of dancing, music, and the eating of sweet treats of all sorts, from chocolate to red &quot;firemint&quot; candies.

No matter her specialization, Gromma has a particular grandmotherly fondness for young members of any race, and will empower members of her party, with the youngest receiving the greatest boost. <br><br>When you want to add Gromma to your party, you can swap her with Nayeli.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/627690/extras/Newsletter_Nov15_Variants.png?t=1523570497\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Feast of the Moon Variants</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Respectful Restraint \u2014 Ultimate Attacks can not be used and any attacks with a cooldown of 5 seconds or less have an additional 3 second cooldown (so a 4 second cooldown becomes 7 seconds, but a 6 second cooldown stays at 6 seconds). These lengthened attacks don't do any additional damage due to their longer cooldown.<br></li><li>The Relentless Undead \u2014 Undead monsters have 2x as much health as normal and, when they take a killing blow, they are stunned for 10 seconds before coming back to life (they still drop gold and quest items and count towards the quest each time they are killed).<br></li><li>A Grand Nandventure \u2014 Gromma Nander is forced to be in your formation. She starts at level 1 in your formation right away alongside Bruenor. She cannot be removed from the formation or swapped out of her seat. She has a 4x damage boost and her normal attack cooldown is reduced by 2 seconds.</li></ul><br>Read more on our official blog <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://codenameentertainment.com/?page=idle_champions&amp;post_id=586#blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >here</a></a>.</p><br><h1>Early Access Update #10: New Tomb of Annihilation Variants &amp; Champion Upgrades</h1><p><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/627690/extras/Newsletter_Nov8_Banner0.png?t=1523570497\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Tomb of Annihilation: New Variants &amp; Upgrades</h2><br>Today Champions can take their next steps into the <i>Tomb of Annihilation</i>, with additional Champion upgrades and two new variants for the first two adventures, <i>Ring of Regeneration: The Death Curse</i> and <i>Seeking Allies: Premature Betrayal</i>.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/627690/extras/Newsletter_Nov8_Banner3.png?t=1523570497\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New Variants!</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The Ring of Regeneration: The Death Curse \u2014 Each time a Champion is killed, they have their damage reduced by 25% permanently for the rest of the adventure (stacks multiplicatively).<br></li><li>Seeking Allies: Premature Betrayal \u2014 Red Wizards of Thay attack your formation in all areas.
