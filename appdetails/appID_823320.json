  "detailed_description": "The game's primary objective is to rank up and join the Generals elite (there's gona be a separate map.... in the future). Get up to 100k score each game to progress faster and get your place on the top 50 scoreboard! To do that you can choose between SinglePlayer or MultiPlayer and deal with AiBots and Challenges.<br />\r\nScattered around the map, there are many different pick-ups. You can get the most points in a round by completing the racing challenges. But beware! AI bots as well as enemy players in multiplayer can disrupt you or worse yet, steal your checkpoints before you can get there yourself! You can also choose to play a CO-OP game against AI and try completing the challenges together. The challenges can be tricky at first, as each checkpoint only lasts 5 seconds after it appears. Proper speed,timing and agility is needed to complete all 3 races. Races are started manually by manouvering through their first checkpoint, so there is no direct rush to start the next race but take too much time and you might be fighting for seconds at the end of the round! The CrazyHousePlanes are equipped with three types of weapons. The main source of damage is your faithful machine gun, always ready to burn down your foes..well, almost always, you might want to throw an eye out on your ammo count every now and then. Your heavy duty damage output comes from the homing missile launcher, locking on your targets when you keep them in your crosshair for a short period of time. The lock-on is indicated by a sound. The third, situational weapon are the rear bombs. Rear bombs are best used against those enemies who don't keep their flying safety distance in check, giving you a proper defense. As this weapon is only meant to be a defensive weapon, it does not increase kill count. The game can be played in 1st person or 3rd person. After each game, the players are rewarded with trophies. You can choose to display up to 8 items from your inventory in games where other players can see them too.",
