Fortunately, they could play after my simple suggestion at the time. But off course, I can not suggest the customer purchase(d) at Steam like you.<br>So now, I have worked on to implement to avoid this problem, but as you know, the game operate on MSX, on a quite small memory, I feel I need more time to complete that, found necessary to inform you.<br>So please suspend to purchase this game till the next update will be done, if you already purchase, please do not play the game and wait the next update. <br><br>Sincerely<br>TOG<br>&lt;^)))))))))&lt;</p><br><h1>2018 INDEPENDENT GAMES FESTIVAL, NUOVO AWARD category Finalist !</h1><p>TAROTICA VOO DOO was selected as a finalist of the NUOVO AWARD category for the 2018 INDEPENDENT GAMES FESTIVAL. Of ~600 games entered, only 8 finalists were selected by the ~300 judges! (more info - <a href=\"http://www.igf.com/article/2018-independent-games-festival-announces-main-competition-finalists\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >announce site</a></a>)</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">WHAT IS TAROTICA VOO DOO?</h2>In development since 1993, TAROTICA VOO DOO is a Japanese ESCAPE ROOM adventure with fully hand-drawn animation (with a mouse!). Despite its simple controls (directional keys and spacebar only), the game overturns the modern logic for how a video game plays. Much like you are picking up a game for the first time again, you will have to rediscover the basics, and apply them to the game\u2019s deceivingly intuitive puzzles and rhythmical combat.<br><br><br>You, equipped with nothing but a sword and shield, climb the cliff to a haunted mansion on a hill. A plane is en route to crash-land into the mansion, and you are the only hope to save the family inside. Unfortunately, today happens to be the family\u2019s memorial dinner day, and evacuation before they have had their fill is not an option. What\u2019s more, there is a horde of monsters and obstacles in between you and getting the family to safety. Get in, navigate the mansion\u2019s bizarre challenges, make dinner, and save the day.<br><br>The main window is a top-down map view of the mansion, where you can move the cursor to search for and select objects in your current room. New areas reveal themselves as you unlock doors and explore. In the upper-right is a zoomed-in view of objects that you interact with and enemies that you fight. Your character is displayed in the bottom-right, where you can transition between defense and attack position. You will be challenged repeatedly by the battles and likely die, but fortunately you can quickly retry without losing progress as many times as you would like. There are no upgrades or leveling up, so conquering the challenges is entirely up to your own wit and persistence.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ABOUT THE CREATOR</h2>The creator of this game, Ikushi Togo, has been making games for the MSX since the 1980s, and he never stopped. He is responsible for all music composition, programming, and hand-drawn artwork for the game. Retro to a fault, he does things by hand and never takes the automated route. Japan was a tech mecca in the 1980s, and was also the innovation hub of gaming as we know it. Still actively using the distinguished technology of the era, Togo-san keeps that old-school spark alive with TAROTICA VOO DOO among his many other games.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CHRONICLES OF TAROTICA VOO DOO</h2>\u201cCHRONICLES OF TAROTICA VOO DOO\u201d is included as a free pdf with the game, and it is far more than a simple manual.
