  "reviews": "\u201cEveryone will agree horror games can truly shine in the world of virtual reality. More often than not, though, those games are mediocre at best. The Exorcist: Legion VR for the HTC Vive is a different game altogether. In fact, it shows how much this new technology can benefit horror games in general.\u201d<br>4 out of 5 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://thevrbase.com/the-exorcist-legion-vr-review-setting-the-bar-for-future-vr-horror-games/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >The VR Base</a></a><br><br>\u201cThe Exorcist: Legion VR is  different. Does it have jump scares? Well you could certainly argue it does, but more importantly it has tension and atmosphere.\u201d<br>4.1 out of 5 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.impulsegamer.com/exorcist-legion-vr-pc-game-review-htc-vive/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Impulse Gamer</a></a><br><br>\u201cThe Exorcist: Legion VR\u2018s debut chapter, \u201cFirst Rites\u201c, tasks players with investigating the brutal murder of a priest in Boston\u2019s St. Vincent de Paul Cathedral. From the moment you step into the chapel the sense of dread is palpable. Like I said at the outset of this review, developer Wolf &amp; Wood has done a stellar job of laying the atmosphere on thick. This is thanks in no small part to the game\u2019s detailed, believable game world and superb audio direction that makes every supernatural encounter a pulse-pounding affair.\u201d<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.heypoorplayer.com/2017/11/29/exorcist-legion-vr-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Hey Poor Player</a></a><br>",
