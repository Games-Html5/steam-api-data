Warfare between the Russian Empire and the Central Powers offers a fresh experience for new and veteran players alike, with four new squads,  20+ weapons, four open maps that give players tactical freedom, and a whole new 64 player game mode with full AI bot support so you can experience epic battles at any time!<br><br>This historical game takes place across the lakes, forests, and snowy plains of the Eastern Front - it was inspired by the Battle of Tannenberg in 1914, one of the most iconic encirclement battles in history. Players will be able to master a range of entirely new equipment brought to the field by Russian \u2018Frontovik\u2019 and \u2018Cossack\u2019 squads, or join the Central Powers to serve in an Austro-Hungarian \u2018K.u.K.\u2019 squad or German \u2018Infanterie\u2019. Tannenberg offers a range of game modes - including the exciting new Maneuver game mode reflecting the different nature of war on the Eastern Front, as 64 players battle across large maps where the objectives and battle lines are always shifting.
