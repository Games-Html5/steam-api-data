During the day you gather necessary items and supplies, taking advantage of the fact that there are no monsters around. Aside from weapons, you have a drone at your disposal. Use it wisely.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">TPP WITH MOVIE-STYLE CAMERA WORK.</h2>Inspired by the first Silent Hill game, Departure is rich in a branching storyline told through the game\u2019s world and events. It\u2019s not a book disguised as a game \u2013 rather it\u2019s an interactive movie full of dynamic camera shots. So stop reading and look at this trailer.
