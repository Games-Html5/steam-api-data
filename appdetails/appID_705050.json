Secondly, we're a completely singleplayer title, and that's the final direction, if you're after an pvp multiplayer experience, so again, your in the wrong place. Thanks!</p><br><h1>Campaign</h1><p><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/705050/extras/Unity_2017-11-20_00-31-43-50.jpg?t=1520518816\" ><br><strong>Our campaign is being written and being implemented into the game.</strong> With huge amounts of content being added once it's finished, including more building mechanics, more vehicles, and with voiced characters!

After purchasing one platform on Steam, all the other platforms will also added to your account free of charge. We're also supporting Vulken and Directx 12.</p><br><h1>Greenlight</h1><p><strong>After three years of development, we're glad to announce that we're on Steam! </strong>To our supporters, thanks for staying with us and keeping track of the development progress through our website and Twitter, we appreciate all of the feedback and we look forward to the final Steam release. If you have already downloaded the apocalypse through our website, then feel free to contact us and we'll let you continue playing on steam free of charge.</p><br><h1>Workshop</h1><p><strong>We now support the steam workshop</strong> for playing on community maps, community modes and more! We'll have an official guide on modding soon available here and on our website. Go to the community section and head to guides. This will be available to the public.</p><br><h1>Controller</h1><p><strong>We've now got full controller support</strong> Thanks to this, we now support all Xbox 360, Xbox One, Xbox Elite, DualShock 4 and DualShock 3 controllers in-game! This was added in the 0.1.1.4.b update. Check out the patch notes for more details.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><strong>Apocalypse is the upcoming survival built entirely by one developer</strong>, with a growing community, the apocalypse focuses on singleplayer apocalyptic survival, with all of the latest graphics technologies integrated together such as Physx 3, Unity 2017.3, Directx 12, and Vulkan API. Built and funded by the community! The final release will feature a fully voiced campaign which follows the life of a survivor, struggling to fight alongside the few established factions left, in one immersive first person shooter experience.

After playing you can head to our community page, our twitter page, or our website and give us feedback, submit any bugs, and suggest more features that you'd like to see in a future update. <strong>Many of the apocalypse's features have been integrated thanks to the community's feedback</strong>, such as the building system, vulken support, and the factions within the campaign.
