  "detailed_description": "Get To The Orange Door, an intense and adrenaline pumping parkour platforming First Person Shooter based around the neon and chrome retro-futurist aesthetic of the 80's. With a mix of classic and modern first person shooter mechanics, wall run, slide, clamber and dash around each level at supersonic speeds as you blow through enemies with unique weaponry and fluid movement mechanics. The objective is in the title.<br><br>Use a varying range of weaponry, from a sword that can deflect bullets all the way to two full auto extended magazine machine pistols that shoot heat seeking rounds. Vending machines and boxes scattered and hidden around each level will help you arm up and prepare for the action!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CURRENT FEATURES</h2><br>6 levels with 21 being the goal for full release<br>Three modes, Default, Ninja, and Race!<br>18 weapons to blow through enemies with!<br>A full parkour system based off of Titanfall 2 and Mirror's Edge movement mechanics. Dashing, double jumping, clambering, and wallrunning mechanics are all at your disposal.<br>Hidden health and parkour upgrades scattered along the levels.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ROADMAP</h2><br>Over the last three months I have completely overhauled the game. New levels, modes, enemies, and just about everything. Not only has the game changed, but the Roadmap has changed as well.

The current roadmap is only a small portion of what I plan to add to the game, but with the nature of the game being very experimental, who knows what could happen. I appreciate you taking the time to check out my game, and I am excited to show you all what I have cooking up next.
