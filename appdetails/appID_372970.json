It is now 100x more reliable.<br></li><li>Cleaned up parsing for scripts so theyre now much more lienient.<br></li><li>Slightly changed the syntax for &quot;else&quot; commands.<br></li><li>Added support for &quot;and&quot;, &quot;or&quot; and &quot;not&quot; if commands.<br></li><li>Replaced &quot;repeat&quot; with then(repeat,...).<br></li><li>External functions have been added, along with the then(function,function, arg1...) then command! Due to potential security issues, a level pack must be trusted in order to run these functions. A subcommand for external functions will be added next patch. THere's no support for more than 2 arguments at the moment, and since I'm going to be changing the internal logic for subcommands, I'll be adding this then.<br></li><li>In the addons section, thumbs-up level packs are now 2x more likely to be randomly selected, while thumbs-downed level packs are half as likely.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Bug Fixes</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Fixed mechanics and health skills in the tutorial.<br></li><li>Fixed a crash caused by finishing a level with the life insurance shield up.</li></ul></p><br><h1>Free Quickplay Demo</h1><p><strong>Want to try out Cash_Out before you buy?
