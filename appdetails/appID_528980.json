  "detailed_description": "<h1>FAQ</h1><p><ul class=\"bb_ul\">   <li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What games are similar to Arakion?</h2> The core of Arakion is based on Blobber RPGs. With that said, Arakion takes inspiration from many games including Might and Magic, Dark Cloud 2, Dungeon Master and many more to create a truly unique experience.<br>   </li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Is Arakion turn-based or real-time?</h2> Arakion will launch with only real-time combat. However, the Arakion engine supports both - implementing turn-based combat as an option is a high priority for after-launch.<br>   </li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How many people are developing Arakion?</h2> Arakion is primarily developed by one person.<br>   </li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Arakion has been in development for a while, what took so long?</h2> I chose to take the time to develop a quality product and engine as opposed to rushing Arakion to market. I was either going to do it right or not do it at all. Players deserve a quality game, no matter how much time it takes.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Enter the world of Arakion, a group based role-playing dungeon crawler that pays homage to classics while adding its own style with fresh mechanics. Lead a band of three heroes through a broken land, ripped apart by unknown forces. Explore a beautiful handcrafted world filled with crumbling dungeons, dense forests, ancient temples, and hidden secrets, all while attempting to build a safe-haven from the chaos.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Story</h2>Play as three adventurers awoken in a world torn by conflict, where the lands and rivers have been ripped from the ground. In midst of this upheaval, there is but one desire - finding a place free from the conflict and chaos. In the search for order, your heroes must find a way to stop the destruction from continuing.<br><br>Between your intrepid adventurers and their goal exists a council of immortal beings. They are known as <strong>The Ancients</strong>. The Ancients wandered Arakion since before written history. Their plan is simple - utter annihilation for all who oppose them. <br><br><strong><i>It's time to begin your story, will you be the world's salvation or destruction?</i></strong><br><img src=\"https://%CDN_HOST_MEDIA_SSL%/steam/apps/528980/extras/UltraThinSeperator.png?t=1522838480\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Background</h2>Arakion takes everything that made classic role-playing games like Might &amp; Magic great, then adds an expansive set of new features. Lead your heroes through the breathtaking, desolated world of Arakion. Explore every alcove for the resources you need to customize your adventurers, build your town, and more. Relive the glory days of role-playing games with this one-of-a-kind experience. Arakion is a beautiful world where you will get lost in adventure and exploration.<br><br>The creators of Arakion have been inspired by a multitude of games - everything from <strong>Dungeon Master</strong> to <strong>Dark Cloud 2</strong>. Our desire is to take everything that makes those games fun and bring it into one amazing package. <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">   <li><i>No leveling up!</i> Arakion features a fresh take on the Role-Playing genre that focuses on choices rather than the grind.<br>   </li><li><i>Control a unique party of three heroes</i> A wide variety of races, professions, and traits adds great diversity to the way you solve conflicts<br>   </li><li><i>Town building</i> Build a town that YOU think would best fit this environment.
