  "detailed_description": "Wrongworld is a surreal and unforgiving survival game set on a low poly world filled with freakish inhabitants.<br><br>You play as a furry little space critter with a bit of a knack for whomping mutants. Crash-landed on a strange and unfamiliar planet, you must decide whether to attempt to rebuild your ship and head home or try to make a new life for yourself. Either way, you'll be exploring, gathering, crafting, discovering, whomping and juggling a powerful need to eat.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">UNFORGIVING SURVIVAL</h2>You're gonna have to figure out the world for yourself and hopefully not die in the process. But you will. Probably a lot. And with perma-death and auto-saving, there's no sneaky reloading to avoid an untimely demise. Just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and try to learn from your fatal experiences. <i>Super-Secret Bonus Hint #1: Food is good. Eat it.</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SILLINESS APLENTY</h2>It might be a brutal world, but you may as well chuckle at the ridiculousness of it all as you go. Obliterate trees with your forehead, fast travel as a non-human cannonball, and become best friends with a cardboard box.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">RANDOMLY GENERATED</h2>The world is completely randomised with every new game. And with a bunch of random events to discover/be subjected to, you're likely to face different hurdles every time you play.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BUILD AN EPIC BASE</h2>Gather resources from across the land, kit yourself out with awesome gear, and build yourself an epic new home. From basics like campfires, simple tools and cooked meals all the way to jet packs, magic potions and maybe even a replacement rocket ship.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">RANDOM COMMENTS FROM AWESOME PEOPLE</h2><br><i>&quot;I don't think I've been this excited for a game in a while...

My 2011 middle-of-the-road laptop can just about cope. But to err on the side of caution and also try to sound a little less clueless about hardware, I'll say an Intel i3 or better is probably wise.<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> You don't need a beast - as mentioned above, my ancient laptop (it's called Larry, by the way) has something known as a Radeon HD 6520G stuffed inside it, and it can just about deliver 30fps with all the settings on &quot;Low&quot;. Definitely wouldn't want to go older/lamer than that, but the fact you're actually looking at 3-dimensional games on Steam makes me think you've probably already got that covered.<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 11<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 500 MB available space<br></li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> As far as I can tell, any on-board chip should work. At least, none of the test machines I have access to have had any problems with sound.<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> As Wrongworld is still in early access and is therefore receiving lots of love and attention to make it run silky-smooth, it's worth noting that system requirements are subject to change for now.</li></ul>"
