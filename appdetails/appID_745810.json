The Dark Lord saw this schism between Animal and Man as an opportunity to overrule the World with His darkness and evil.

Your quest begins with your Tribe being attacked by the forces of evil, when many parts of the World are set afire, people are being captured and offered for sacrifice, causing much pain and suffering. As the sole survivor, unsure of why you were spared during the torment and massacre, your mission is to find your people, free them, and fortify your Tribe\u2019s village. The only way to defeat the Dark Lord is to summon the collective power of the 11 Spirit Animals, using their gifts and abilities to kill the Soldiers of Darkness and their armies of destruction.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/745810/extras/tribeAndAnimalssitting.jpg?t=1523701405\" >",
