She then wrote &quot;Battle Splash&quot;, a game inside B.O.S.s that features high speed Water Balloons and Water simulation in order to create the most intense Squirt Gun Battle ever. She then invited her friend (Temiko Kangara), her cousin (Pentaga Polyga) and her sister (Quadra Polyga) to test the game out.
