  "detailed_description": "Null Vector is an arcade shooter that blends rogue-lite elements with retro-style fun. Herald back to simpler times as you pilot and blast through enemy-filled rooms to complete your one mission: Seek and Destroy the Final Boss! On your way, collect pickups to upgrade your ship, avoid damage and the Game Over screen while racking up points, and fight to enter your name to the top of the high score leaderboards. It certainly won\u2019t be easy, but it definitely will be fun! <br><br>Inspired by the Binding of Isaac and arcade classics, such as Asteroids, Battlezone, and Smash TV, Null Vector brings the quarter-eater fun and difficulty of the 1980\u2019s to the 21st century, without stealing your candy money! Survive and explore six sectors of varied enemies, mini-bosses, and bullet-hell, collecting upgrades and pick-ups as you blast through your run. Limited to a 3 slot loadout, you must pick and choose from 14 weapon and upgrade pickups, ranging from lasers and rockets to helper bots and fire rate bonuses. In addition, you\u2019ll also have to manage your hit points and crystals. With no saves, annihilation means game over, giving you only one shot to complete your mission. Fear not though - crystals can be traded for HP, weapon and upgrade pickups, and other interesting benefits to bring you one room closer to defeating the Final Boss. With difficulty modifiers to rack up your score and difficulty, there are hours of fun and challenge to be had with Null Vector. And, if you feel more adventurous, Hell Mode awaits\u2026 <br><br>What are you waiting for?
