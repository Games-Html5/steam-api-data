  "detailed_description": "<strong>The Scout</strong> is the first episode in Soma Games' Lost Legends of Redwall. Set in the wildly popular world of best-selling books, <strong>Redwall</strong>, by Brian Jacques.<br><br>Not too far from the storied walls of Redwall Abbey is a small village of mice and moles called Lilygrove. Our hero, Sophia, is the newest member of the Lilygrove Scout Corps, a group of woodland rangers tasked with the protection of the little village and trained in the ancient ways of woodcraft. But her graduation is cut short by the sudden raid from a band of sea rats led by the brutal wearet, Scumsnout. It will take all of her wit and guile to make it out alive and all the way to Redwall to call for help!<br><br>-----<br>The Scout is our first Redwall episode and is a new story that takes place in the middle of winter, about 6 months prior to the events of the book, Redwall. Future episodes tell the tales of three reluctant heroes who each find themselves inside Redwall Abbey for deeply personal reasons when it is besieged by Cluny the Scourge. Thrust into a suddenly dramatic situation the three strangers become fast friends and wind up in a critical, but as-yet unsung role in the events that bring the sword of Martin the Warrior to Matthias and the end to that villain Cluny the Scourge.<br><br>As the first episode in the series, The Scout is best understood as a stealth-adventure game set in the winter before the Summer of the Late Rose. It tells the story of a mouse who is driven to Redwall Abbey when sea rats raid the peaceful village of Lilygrove. The events of The Scout play out along the ancient, but now altered, course of the mighty River Moss. What was once a wide river is now the sunken bed of a seasonal creek that that runs east-west between Redwall Abbey and the Great South Stream that feeds the swamps south and east of Salamandastron. The player must find a way through the confusing snow-covered channel punctuated by occasional hedgerows, ancient stone walls, scattered shacks, and the few-and-far-between hearths of friendly woodlanders.<br><br>Along the way there is untold adventure to include (of course) feasting, fiddling, and even a few fisticuffs as we meet Valo Scrimpaw, the mysterious stoat who lives in the Winsome Wraith, Scumsnout the murderous weret and the mysterious, ghostly assistance when all seems lost.",
