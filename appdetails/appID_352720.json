Every tree your civilization cuts down, every resource they mine and every animal they hunt will affect the world they\u2019re living in. A lack of trees and high levels of pollution will raise the global temperature over time, while reckless hunting or fishing might cause the extinction of some species. It\u2019s your mission to manage how the Nuggets collect and utilize resources. What mark will you leave on the ecosystems that existed millions of years before your arrival? Will you use every available resource and expand at an unprecedented pace, or will you methodically create a more sustainable way of life for your civilization?<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/352720/extras/Organic.png?t=1523340458\" ><br><br>These are living, breathing worlds where everything is interconnected.

Every planet comes with a few surprises that are sure to challenge your civilization. From tornadoes that consume everything in their path, to thunderous earthquakes that threaten to split your civilization in two. If you treat nature poorly, it might just show you how brutal and unforgiving it can be. Each planet you encounter will have a unique underbelly. Some planets are tranquil and filled to the brim with resources, while others are barren and dangerous.

Wild animal attacks are more common at night, as are frequent temperature drops. Daytime offers a little more safety from the harshness of the world. With the inclusion of a full, four-season cycle, a planet\u2019s biomes can change drastically, making it extremely difficult for Nuggets to survive brutal winters without proper preparation ahead of time.",
