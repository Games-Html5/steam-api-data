When you can move over 500 mph, you need somewhere to fly around! If you can see something miles away, it's real, you can go there. Travel not only on the islands at sea level, but also the astroids in the sky and the caves deep below!<br></li><li> <strong>Go Solo or Online</strong> - Seamlessly play single player or online multiplayer at any time in the same open world. In-game voice allows you to easily socialize and cooperate with other players. Team up against the giant boss or face off in PvP mini-games.<br></li><li> <strong>Colossal Boss Fight</strong> - Millions of years ago, the flying beast of Jet Island destroyed the ancient alien civilization that once lived here. Now he guards this giant floating island in space, claiming it as his own. He is 3.7 miles long and rumbles the ground as he flies overhead. It is up to you and your friends to defeat him!<br></li><li> <strong>No Limits!</strong> - Jet Island is a game about full freedom! There are no speed limits, no invisible walls, no one right path.
