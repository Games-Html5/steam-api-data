There are two noteworthy bugs. first, because the full game is not out, you may get a &quot;can't install&quot; error, when trying to play the demo. Just keep on pressing &quot;yes&quot; and the demo will override and install. This is a Steam bug, as Steam is not really made for demos being out a year in advance of the game.<br><br>Second, you can't yet play the demo on laptops. I'll have this feature ready by Christmas, but right now the resolution scaling is not implemented for monitors smaller than 1920px.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>An interactive fiction adventure-strategy parody. Send agents on missions, build your base, research occult superweapons and buy units. Along the way, unlock occult mysteries. Plus romance Kelly from Mass Effect.

First, you may get an error trying to install the demo as Steam is saying &quot;No can't install full version yet&quot;. Just keep pressing &quot;yes&quot; and the demo will install. Second, the game does not yet scale to laptop monitors, only 1920px and 2560px. I will fix this by Christmas.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A parody of Mass Effect and The Secret World<br></li><li>Deep adventure-strategy gameplay<br></li><li>Detailed interactive fiction</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Parody of Mass Effect and The Secret World</h2><br>Command a troupe of movie cosplayers with a collective IQ of 100.
