Remember... in a world made of neons... you will need balls to survive.<br><br>Neonwall is an innovative game that mixes the genres of puzzle and action to develop an addictive and frenetic gameplay. You do not handle the ball, you interact with it and the world around it. The objective is to take the ball to the goal avoiding the obstacles that block the way.<br><br>The way to interact in the game is with two colored lasers controlled with the joystick, the lasers can break blocks, move them and most importantly exchange the color with the neon ball. The color in Neonwall is very important! The ball moves faster, opens doors on the floor and walls of its color. Lasers only interact with elements of the same color. In short you have three colors have to be exchanged between the lasers and the ball, if done correctly and accurately victory is a possibility.<br><br><strong>THE EXPERIENCE</strong><br><br>The most immersive experience is with the use of a virtual reality viewer, if you do not have one, Neonwall has also been optimized to enjoy with a joystick and your monitor.",
